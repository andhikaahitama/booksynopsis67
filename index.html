Harold, Chester, and Howie are guarding the Monroe house -- especially a batch of Mr. Monroe&#39;s famous fudge. But they fall asleep -- and wake up to discover the fudge has turned white! Has Bunnicula acquired a taste for chocolate in addition to vegetables? Chester is sure of it! But then the fudge disappears -- and it&#39;s up to Harold, Chester, and Howie to catch the thief!</p><p>James Howe&nbsp;is the author of more than ninety books for young readers.&nbsp;<i>Bunnicula</i>, coauthored by his late wife Deborah and published in 1979, is considered a modern classic of children&#x2019;s literature. The author has written six highly popular sequels, along with the spinoff series&nbsp;Tales from the House of Bunnicula&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bunnicula and Friends.&nbsp;Among his other books are picture books such as <i>Horace and Morris but Mostly Dolores&nbsp;</i>and beginning reader series that include the Pinky and Rex and Houndsley and Catina books. He has also written for older readers.&nbsp;<i>The Misfits,</i>&nbsp;published in 2001, inspired the antibullying initiative No Name-Calling Week, as well as three sequels,&nbsp;<i>Totally Joe</i>,<i> Addie on the Inside</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Also Known as&nbsp;Elvis.&nbsp;</i>A common theme in James Howe&#x2019;s books from preschool through teens is the acceptance of difference and being true to oneself.

Visit him at JeffMack.com.Kindergarten-Grade 3-- Harold and Chester are back in another picture-book adventure--a mouth-watering treat for chocolate-loving Bunnicula (Atheneum, 1979) fans. Hot Fudge, in this case, refers to the pilfered variety, and, when a plate of the rich, brown, gooey stuff appears to have turned white, the vampire bunny is the prime suspect. These abbreviated adventures of the Monroe family pets can't hold a candle to their full-length predecessors. Still, Harold's breezy narrative has the same ingenuous charm, nicely tempered, as always, by Chester's arrogant pragmatism. And, if Morrill's watercolors seem a bit innocuous, his animal characters do have spirit and are more than equal to the task. Salivating fudge fanciers will welcome "Mr. Monroe's Famous Fudge" recipe, complete with admonishments against sharing the treat with their pets. --Marcia Hupp, Mamaroneck Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Healing Self-Injury: A Compassionate Guide for Parents and Other Loved Ones</h2><p>Subtle scars disappearing up a shirt sleeve, unexplained bruises, burn marks. As many as one out of every four young people engage in non-suicidal self-injury, defined as the deliberate destruction of body tissue without suicidal intent. Parents who uncover this alarming behavior are gripped by uncertainty and flooded with questions--why is my child doing this? Is this a suicide attempt? What did I do wrong? What can I do to stop it? And yet basic educational resources for parents with self-injuring children are sorely lacking.<br><br><em>Healing Self-Injury</em> provides desperately-needed guidance to parents and others who love a young person struggling with self-injury. First and foremost, adolescent psychologists Janis Whitlock and Elizabeth Lloyd-Richardson believe that parents must appreciate how important their role is in their child's recovery; there is a lot that parents can do to support their self-injuring children. This book offers strategies for identifying and alleviating sources of distress in children's lives, improving family communication (particularly around emotions), and seeking professional help. Importantly, it also provides compassionate advice to parents with personal challenges of their own, explaining how these can impact the entire family. The book will help parents partner with their children to identify, build, and use skills that will assist them in recovering from self-injury. Vivid anecdotes drawn from the authors' extensive in-depth interviews with real families in recovery from self-injury put a human face on what for many families is a distressing and often isolating experience.<br><br><em>Healing Self-Injury</em> is a must-have for parents who want to assist in their child's recovery, as well as for anyone who lives with, works with, or cares about self-injuring youth and their families.<br></p><p><br><strong>Janis Whitlock, Ph.D.</strong>, is a Research Scientist in the Bronfenbrenner Center for Translational Research at Cornell University, and is the founder and director of the Cornell Research Program on Self-Injury and Recovery. Dedicated to linking cutting edge science with on-the-ground efforts to support and enhance the lives of youth and their families, her research focuses on adolescent and young adult social and emotional health and wellbeing, sexual violence prevention, and the role of social media in health and development. She is best known for her work on non-suicidal self-injury. In addition to conducting research in these areas, she is dedicated to making research accessible and useful to those best positioned to make a difference in the lives of youth, such as parents and youth-serving professionals. <br><br><strong>Elizabeth E. Lloyd-Richardson, Ph.D.</strong>, is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. She is a licensed Clinical Psychologist with specialized training in adolescent health risk behaviors. She began conducting research on and interviewing teens who self-injure nearly two decades ago, and has extensive experience in developing and running research programs that aim to promote healthful behaviors in adolescents and young adults. She has authored over 60 papers and book chapters in the areas of non-suicidal self-injury, weight management, and substance use and abuse.<br><br>"Whitlock and Lloyd-Richardson have produced a book that is rigorous, accessible, engaging and full of practical guidance. They lay out a clear and comprehensive foundation to help families understand how self-injury develops, what it means, how it can be treated, and finally-and maybe most important-how young people and families can emerge from this problem with more insight and inner strength, and with stronger connections. I highly recommend this work for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of this complex and vexing phenomenon." <br> <br>-- <em>Victor Schwartz, MD, Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry, NYU School of Medicine, and Chief Medical Officer, The Jed Foundation</em><p></p><br>"Drs. Whitlock and Lloyd-Richardson, experts in the field of self-injury, have produced a book that is equal parts evidence-based, empathic, and actionable. Self-injury need not be more frightening and confusing than other problems facing adolescents. I highly recommend this guide to parents seeking to better understand and help with their children's self-injury." <br> <br>-- <em>E. David Klonsky, PhD, Professor of Psychology, University of British Columbia</em><p></p><br>"A must-read for anyone who knows a self-injuring teen! This beautifully-written and extraordinarily well-informed guide offers comfort, explanations, and a detailed plan for parents of adolescents suffering from one of today's most troubling and dangerous risky behaviors. Whitlock and Lloyd-Richardson are national experts on self-injury who have translated the science into a remarkably accessible and essential resource!" <br> <br>-- <em>Mitch Prinstein, PhD, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, author of</em> Popular: Finding Happiness and Success in a World That Cares Too Much About the Wrong Kinds of Relationships<p></p><br></p><h2>The Elementary / Middle School Counselor&#39;s Survival Guide, Third Edition</h2><p><p>An expanded edition filled with ideas, strategies, and tools for school counselors</p> <p>This <em>Survival Guide</em> helps counselors plan and implement an effective counseling program tailored to the needs of all students.

In the sumptuous <i>My Very First Book of Food,</i> children can match each animal with the food it eats. Do you know what a squirrel eats? How about a seal? In <i>My Very First Book of Motion,</i> children can match each animal with the way it moves. Which animal hops? Which one waddles? Only you can match them. These fun books are full of bright animals, and are lots of fun for young children.</p><p>Eric Carle is acclaimed and beloved as the creator of brilliantly illustrated and innovatively designed picture books for very young children. His best-known work, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>, has eaten its way into the hearts of literally millions of children all over the world and has been translated into more than 25 languages and sold over twelve million copies. Since the <b>Caterpillar</b> was published in 1969, Eric Carle has illustrated more than sixty books, many best sellers, most of which he also wrote.<p>Born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929, Eric Carle moved with his parents to Germany when he was six years old; he was educated there, and graduated from the prestigious art school, the Akademie der bildenden Kunste, in Stuttgart. But his dream was always to return to America, the land of his happiest childhood memories. So, in 1952, with a fine portfolio in hand and forty dollars in his pocket, he arrived in New York. Soon he found a job as a graphic designer in the promotion department of <i>The New York Times</i>. Later, he was the art director of an advertising agency for many years.</p><p>One day, respected educator and author, Bill Martin Jr, called to ask Carle to illustrate a story he had written. Martin's eye had been caught by a striking picture of a red lobster that Carle had created for an advertisement. <b>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</b> was the result of their collaboration. It is still a favorite with children everywhere. This was the beginning of Eric Carle's true career. Soon Carle was writing his own stories, too. His first wholly original book was <b>1,2,3 to the Zoo</b>, followed soon afterward by the celebrated classic, <b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>.</p><p>Eric Carle's art is distinctive and instantly recognizable. His art work is created in collage technique, using hand-painted papers, which he cuts and layers to form bright and cheerful images. Many of his books have an added dimension - die-cut pages, twinkling lights as in <b>The Very Lonely Firefly</b>, even the lifelike sound of a cricket's song as in <b>The Very Quiet Cricket</b> - giving them a playful quality: a toy that can be read, a book that can be touched. Children also enjoy working in collage and many send him pictures they have made themselves, inspired by his illustrations. He receives hundreds of letters each week from his young admirers. The secret of Eric Carle's books' appeal lies in his intuitive understanding of and respect for children, who sense in him instinctively someone who shares their most cherished thoughts and emotions.</p><p>The themes of his stories are usually drawn from his extensive knowledge and love of nature - an interest shared by most small children. Besides being beautiful and entertaining, his books always offer the child the opportunity to learn something about the world around them. It is his concern for children, for their feelings and their inquisitiveness, for their creativity and their intellectual growth that, in addition to his beautiful artwork, makes the reading of his books such a stimulating and lasting experience.</p><p>Carle says: "With many of my books I attempt to bridge the gap between the home and school. To me home represents, or should represent; warmth, security, toys, holding hands, being held. School is a strange and new place for a child. Will it be a happy place? There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun."</p><p>Eric Carle has two grown-up children, a son and a daughter. With his wife Barbara, he lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.

Christopher currently lives in Seattle, Washington.Gr 4-7-Left alone at the vet's, Max has had no food or water for two days. All of the other dogs and the people have disappeared. He begins to sink into despair when Rocky, a small dachshund, flies through the room and gives him brief instructions on how to escape the kennel. As the Labrador retriever wearily pinches the latch open using just his teeth, he takes his fill of water and explores his eerily empty environment. Approaching the front entrance, he sees a wolf trying to break in, searching for the small dog that saved him, and their food. Max and Rocky best the wolves, but are later forced to flee. Thus begins their adventure through villages, cities, forests, and waterways in search of their now-missing pack leaders and the missing people. Part Incredible Journey and part Life as We Knew It, this is an interesting blend of genres that allows accessibility to the traditional YA dystopian-future genre. The pacing of the story can be slow at times as it is told in episodic segments characterized by new settings and cultures of dogs. This approach would be appealing to those who may prefer to read in bursts rather than long periods at a time, but keeping track of so many characters and settings could also prove a challenge to some readers. The book is illustrated with a number of images that greatly enhance some chapters. Patient readers ready for thick books will find a lot to enjoy in this cliff-hanging first installment.-Devin Burritt, Wells Public Library, ME&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Four years later, Alfie doesn't know where his father might be, other than that he's away on a special, secret mission. Then, while shining shoes at King's Cross Station, Alfie unexpectedly sees his father's name on a sheaf of papers belonging to a military doctor. Bewildered and confused, Alfie realizes his father is in a hospital close by&#x2015;a hospital treating soldiers with shell shock. Alfie isn't sure what shell shock is, but he is determined to rescue his father from this strange, unnerving place. . . .in John Boyne's <i>Stay Where You Are and Then Leave.</i></p><p>This title has Common Core connections.</p></p><p><p><b>John Boyne</b> was born in Ireland in 1971 and is the author of several novels.

And with every passing day, it became harder and harder to keep the memories clear in his head. <br>The fighting had started on July 28, 1914. Others might not have remembered that date so easily, but Alfie would never forget it, for that was his birthday. He had turned five years old that day and his parents threw him a party to celebrate, but only a handful of people showed up: Granny Summerfield, who sat in the corner, weeping into her handkerchief and saying, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re finished, we&#x2019;re all finished,&#x201d; over and over, until Alfie&#x2019;s mum said that if she couldn&#x2019;t get ahold of herself she would have to leave; Old Bill Hemperton, the Australian from next door, who was about a hundred years old and played a trick with his false teeth, sliding them in and out of his mouth using nothing but his tongue; Alfie&#x2019;s best friend, Kalena Jan�cek, who lived three doors down at number six, and her father, who ran the sweet shop on the corner and had the shiniest shoes in London. Alfie invited most of his friends from Damley Road, but that morning, one by one, their mothers knocked on the Summerfields&#x2019; front door and said that little so-and-so wouldn&#x2019;t be able to come. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a day for a party, is it?&#x201d; asked Mrs. Smythe from number nine, the mother of Henry Smythe, who sat in the seat in front of Alfie in school and made at least ten disgusting smells every day. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s best if you just cancel it, dear.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not canceling anything,&#x201d; said Alfie&#x2019;s mother, Margie, throwing up her hands in frustration after the fifth parent had come to call. &#x201c;If anything, we should be doing our best to have a good time today. And what am I to do with all this grub if no one shows up?&#x201d; <br>Alfie followed her into the kitchen and looked at the table, where corned-beef sandwiches, stewed tripe, pickled eggs, cold tongue, and jellied eels were all laid out in a neat row, covered over with tea towels to keep them fresh. <br>&#x201c;I can eat it,&#x201d; said Alfie, who liked to be helpful. <br>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; said Margie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you can. You&#x2019;re a bottomless pit, Alfie Summerfield. I don&#x2019;t know where you put it all. Honest, I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>When Alfie&#x2019;s dad, Georgie, came home from work at lunchtime that day, he had a worried expression on his face. He didn&#x2019;t go out to the backyard to wash up like he usually did, even though he smelled a bit like milk and a bit like a horse. Instead, he stood in the front parlor reading a newspaper before folding it in half, hiding it under one of the sofa cushions, and coming into the kitchen. <br>&#x201c;All right, Margie,&#x201d; he said, pecking his wife on the cheek. <br>&#x201c;All right, Georgie.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All right, Alfie,&#x201d; he said, tousling the boy&#x2019;s hair. <br>&#x201c;All right, Dad.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Happy birthday, son. What age are you now anyway, twenty-seven?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>five,</i>&#x201d; said Alfie, who couldn&#x2019;t imagine what it would be like to be twenty-seven but felt very grown up to think that he was five at last. <br>&#x201c;Five. I see,&#x201d; said Georgie, scratching his chin. &#x201c;Seems like you&#x2019;ve been around here a lot longer than that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Out! Out! Out!&#x201d; shouted Margie, waving her hands to usher them back into the front parlor. Alfie&#x2019;s mum always said there was nothing that annoyed her more than having her two men under her feet when she was trying to cook. And so Georgie and Alfie did what they were told, playing a game of Snakes and Ladders at the table by the window as they waited for the party to begin. <br>&#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; said Alfie. <br>&#x201c;Yes, son?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How was Mr. Asquith today?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Much better.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Did the vet take a look at him?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He did, yes. Whatever was wrong with him seems to have worked its way out of his system.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Asquith was Georgie&#x2019;s horse. Or rather he was the dairy&#x2019;s horse; the one who pulled Georgie&#x2019;s milk float every morning when he was delivering the milk. Alfie had named him the day he&#x2019;d been assigned to Georgie a year before; he&#x2019;d heard the name so often on the wireless radio that it seemed it could only belong to someone very important, and so he decided it was just right for a horse. <br>&#x201c;Did you give him a pat for me, Dad?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I did, son,&#x201d; said Georgie. <br>Alfie smiled. He loved Mr. Asquith. He absolutely loved him. <br>&#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; said Alfie a moment later. <br>&#x201c;Yes, son?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can I come to work with you tomorrow?&#x201d; <br>Georgie shook his head. &#x201c;Sorry, Alfie. You&#x2019;re still too young for the milk float. It&#x2019;s more dangerous than you realize.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But you said that I could when I was older.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And when you&#x2019;re older, you can.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m older now,&#x201d; said Alfie. &#x201c;I could help all our neighbors when they come to fill their milk jugs at the float.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than my job&#x2019;s worth, Alfie.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, I could keep Mr. Asquith company while you filled them yourself.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry, son,&#x201d; said Georgie. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re still not old enough.&#x201d; <br>Alfie sighed. There was nothing in the world he wanted more than to ride the milk float with his dad and help deliver the milk every morning, feeding lumps of sugar to Mr. Asquith between streets, even though it meant getting up in the middle of the night. The idea of being out in the streets and seeing the city when everyone else was still in bed sent a shiver down his spine. And being his dad&#x2019;s right-hand man? What could be better? He&#x2019;d asked whether he could do it at least a thousand times, but every time he asked, the answer was always the same: <i>Not yet, Alfie, you&#x2019;re still too young.</i> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember when you were five?&#x201d; asked Alfie. <br>&#x201c;I do, son. That was the year my old man died. That was a rough year.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How did he die?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Down the mines.&#x201d; <br>Alfie thought about it. He knew only one person who had died. Kalena&#x2019;s mother, Mrs. Jan�cek, who had passed away from tuberculosis. Alfie could spell that word. <i>T-u-b-e-r-c-u-l-o-s-i-s.</i> <br>&#x201c;What happened then?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;When your dad died.&#x201d; <br>Georgie thought about it for a moment and shrugged his shoulders. &#x201c;Well, we moved to London, didn&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Your Granny Summerfield said there was nothing in Newcastle for us anymore. She said if we came here we could make a fresh start. She said I was the man of the house now.&#x201d; He threw a five and a six, landed on blue 37, and slid down a snake all the way to white 19. &#x201c;Just my luck,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be able to stay up late tonight, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Alfie asked, and his dad nodded. <br>&#x201c;Just for you, I will,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Since it&#x2019;s your birthday, I&#x2019;ll stay up till nine. How does that sound?&#x201d; <br>Alfie smiled; Georgie never went to bed any later than seven o&#x2019;clock at night because of his early starts. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m no good without my beauty sleep,&#x201d; he always said, which made Margie laugh, and then he would turn to Alfie and say, &#x201c;Your mum only agreed to marry me on account of my good looks. But if I don&#x2019;t get a decent night&#x2019;s sleep I get dark bags under my eyes and my face grows white as a ghost and she&#x2019;ll run off with the postman.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I ran off with a milkman, and much good it did me,&#x201d; Margie always said in reply, but she didn&#x2019;t mean it, because then they&#x2019;d look at each other and smile, and sometimes she would yawn and say that she fancied an early night too, and up they&#x2019;d go to bed, which meant Alfie had to go to bed too and this proved one thing to him: that yawning was contagious. <br>Despite the disappointing turnout for his birthday party, Alfie tried not to mind too much. He knew that something was going on out there in the real world, something that all the adults were talking about, but it seemed boring and he wasn&#x2019;t really interested anyway. There&#x2019;d been talk about it for months; the grown-ups were forever saying that something big was just around the corner, something that was going to affect them all. Sometimes Georgie would tell Margie that it was going to start any day now and they&#x2019;d have to be ready for it, and sometimes, when she got upset, he said that she had nothing to worry about, that everything would turn out tickety-boo in the end, and that Europe was far too civilized to start a scrap that no one could possibly hope to win. <br>When the party started, everyone tried to be cheerful and pretend that it was a day just like any other. They played Hot Potato, where everyone sat in a circle and passed a hot potato to the next person and the first to drop it was out. (Kalena won that game.) Old Bill Hemperton set up a game of Penny Pitch in the front parlor, and Alfie came away three farthings the richer. Granny Summerfield handed everyone a clothes peg and placed an empty milk bottle on the floor. Whoever could drop the peg into the bottle from the highest was the winner. (Margie was twice as good as everyone else at this.) But soon the adults stopped talking to the children and huddled together in corners with glum expressions on their faces while Alfie and Kalena listened in to their conversations and tried to understand what they were talking about. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re better off signing up now before they call you,&#x201d; Old Bill Hemperton said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll go easier on you in the end, you mark my words.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Be quiet, you,&#x201d; snapped Granny Summerfield, who lived in the house opposite Old Bill at number eleven and had never got along with him because he played his gramophone every morning with the windows open. She was a short, round woman who always wore a hairnet and kept her sleeves rolled up as if she were just about to go to work. &#x201c;Georgie&#x2019;s not signing up for anything.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Might not have a choice, Mum,&#x201d; said Georgie, shaking his head. <br>&#x201c;Shush&#x2014;not in front of Alfie,&#x201d; said Margie, tugging on his arm. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying that this thing could run and run for years. I might have a better chance if I volunteer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;ll all be over by Christmas,&#x201d; said Mr. Jan�cek, whose black leather shoes were so shiny that almost everyone had remarked upon them. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what everyone is saying.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shush&#x2014;not in front of Alfie,&#x201d; said Margie again, raising her voice now. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re finished, we&#x2019;re all finished!&#x201d; cried Granny Summerfield, taking her enormous handkerchief from her pocket and blowing her nose so loudly that Alfie burst out laughing. Margie didn&#x2019;t find it so funny, though; she started to cry and ran out of the room, and Georgie ran after her. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>More than four years had passed since that day, but Alfie still thought about it all the time. He was nine years old now and hadn&#x2019;t had any birthday parties in the years in between. But when he was going to sleep at night, he did his best to put together all the things he could remember about his family before they&#x2019;d changed, because if he remembered them the way they used to be, then there was always the chance that one day they could be that way again. <br>Georgie and Margie had been very old when they got married&#x2014;he knew that much. His dad had been almost twenty-one and his mum was only a year younger. Alfie found it hard to imagine what it would be like to be twenty-one years old. He thought that it would be difficult to hear things and that your sight would be a little fuzzy. He thought you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get up out of the broken armchair in front of the fireplace without groaning and saying, &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s me turning in for the night then.&#x201d; He guessed that the most important things in the world to you would be a nice cup of tea, a comfortable pair of slippers, and a cozy cardigan. Sometimes when he thought about it, he knew that one day he would be twenty-one years old too, but it seemed so far in the future that it was hard to imagine. He&#x2019;d taken a piece of paper and pen once and written the numbers down, and he realized that it would be 1930 before he was that age. 1930! That was centuries away. All right, maybe not centuries, but that&#x2019;s the way Alfie thought about it. <br>Alfie&#x2019;s fifth birthday party was both a happy and a sad memory. It was happy because he&#x2019;d received some good presents: a set of eighteen different-colored crayons and a sketchbook from his parents; a secondhand copy of <i>The Life and Most Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</i> from Mr. Jan�cek, who said that it would probably be too difficult for him now but that he&#x2019;d be able to read it one day; a bag of sherbet lemons from Kalena. And he didn&#x2019;t mind that some of the presents were boring: a pair of socks from Granny Summerfield and a map of Australia from Old Bill Hemperton, who said that someday he might want to go Down Under, and if that day ever came, then this map was sure to come in handy. <br>&#x201c;See there?&#x201d; said Old Bill, pointing at a spot near the top of the map, where the green of the edges turned brown in the center. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m from. A town called Mareeba. Finest little town in all of Australia. Anthills the size of houses. If you ever go there, Alfie, you tell them Old Bill Hemperton sent you, and they&#x2019;ll treat you like one of their own. I&#x2019;m a hero back there on account of my connections.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What connections?&#x201d; he asked, but Old Bill only winked and shook his head. <br>Alfie didn&#x2019;t know what to make of this, but in the days that followed he pinned the map to his bedroom wall anyway, he wore the socks that Granny Summerfield had given him, he used most of the coloring pencils and all of the sketchbook, he tried to read <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> but struggled with it (although he put it on his shelf to come back to when he was older), and he shared the sherbet lemons with Kalena. <br>These were the good memories. <br>The sad ones existed because that was when everything had changed. All the men from Damley Road had gathered outside on the street as the sun went down, their shirtsleeves rolled up, tugging at their braces as they spoke about things they called &#x201c;duty&#x201d; and &#x201c;responsibility,&#x201d; taking little puffs of their cigarettes before pinching the tips closed again and putting the butts back in their waistcoat pockets for later on. Georgie had got into an argument with his oldest and closest friend, Joe Patience, who lived at number sixteen, about what they called the rights and wrongs of it all. Joe and Georgie had been friends since Georgie and Granny Summerfield moved to Damley Road&#x2014;Granny Summerfield said that Joe had practically grown up in her kitchen&#x2014;and had never exchanged a cross word until that afternoon. It was the day when Charlie Slipton, the paper boy from number twenty-one, who&#x2019;d once thrown a stone at Alfie&#x2019;s head for no reason whatsoever, had come up and down the street six times with later and later editions of the newspaper, and managed to sell them all without even trying. And it was the day that had ended with Alfie&#x2019;s mum sitting in the broken armchair in front of the fireplace, sobbing as if the end of the world was upon them. <br>&#x201c;Come on, Margie,&#x201d; Georgie said, standing behind her and rubbing her neck. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to cry about, is there? Remember what everyone said&#x2014;it&#x2019;ll all be over by Christmas. I&#x2019;ll be back here in time to help stuff the goose.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And you believe that, do you?&#x201d; Margie said, looking up at him, her eyes red-rimmed with tears. &#x201c;You believe what they tell you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What else can we do but believe?&#x201d; said Georgie. &#x201c;We have to hope for the best.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Promise me, Georgie Summerfield,&#x201d; said Margie. &#x201c;Promise me you won&#x2019;t sign up.&#x201d; <br>There was a long pause before Alfie&#x2019;s dad spoke again. &#x201c;You heard what Old Bill said, love. It might be easier on me in the long term if&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And what about me? And Alfie? Will it be easier on us? Promise me, Georgie!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All right, love. Let&#x2019;s just see what happens, shall we? All them politicians might wake up tomorrow morning and change their minds about the whole thing anyway. We could be worrying over nothing.&#x201d; <br>Alfie wasn&#x2019;t su...</p><h2>Can a Cat Do That?/Ready-to-Read Ready-to-Go! (The World of Eric Carle)</h2><p><b>Butterflies can fly.

Does your spiritual life feel listless and boring? Perhaps you've unconsciously drifted toward what Clare De Graaf calls <i>beige Christianity</i>. You go to church, attend a Bible study, and even volunteer, but there's no spark anymore--no joy in your spiritual walk. You may not understand what is happening to your faith, but you do know that you long for something more.<br> <br>If you want to break out of this <i>spiritual gerbil cage</i> and begin living the adventure Jesus intends for you, the place to begin again is living by The 10-Second Rule: <i>Just do the next thing you're reasonably certain Jesus wants you to do (and do it within the next ten seconds before you change your mind!)</i>.<br> <br>The Rule is like a spiritual defibrillator! Just a few chapters in, you'll begin to experience the excitement of making yourself available to God 24-7, and impacting the lives of everyone around you, even total strangers. All over the world, Christians just like you are returning to the simple faith of Jesus and living by the 10-Second Rule. In living by the Rule, you'll rediscover the revolutionary power of simple obedience as Jesus taught it, the early church lived it, and before religious Christianity tamed it. <br> <br>Finally, a rule you'll love keeping!</p><p>Clare DeGraaf is a follower of Jesus, an elder, Bible teacher, and blogger. For more than thirty years, he&#x2019;s been a full-time spiritual mentor of men all over the world&#x2014;from college students to business and church leaders.

Clare and his wife, Susan, live in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and are the parents of six children and grandparents of fifteen.The 10-Second Rule <br><br> CHAPTER ONE<p></p> A Rule of Life<p></p> <br>The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting.<br> <br>It has been found difficult and left untried.<br> <br>&#x2014;G. K. CHESTERTON<br> <br>The knock on the passenger-side window was so loud and unexpected it startled them both&#x2014;father and son. That the father had been in the middle of an ATM withdrawal, cash in hand, only heightened his anxiety. But when he turned toward the sound of the knocking, his reflexes now on full alert, heart pounding, there was only a frail old woman standing at the passenger window, her nose nearly touching it, looking timid and more frightened than he was. The father almost laughed out loud. She&#x2019;d scared the wits out of both of them! &#x201c;Son, roll down your window, please,&#x201d; he said. For his son&#x2019;s sake he tried to sound more confident than he felt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is there any way you could help me get some food for my grandchildren?&#x201d; the old woman asked.<br> <br>The father, a former lawyer recently turned pastor, was skeptical. He saw no reason to be afraid of this woman, but neither did he see any reason to trust that she was telling the truth. Was this a scam? It didn&#x2019;t help that his son, his face turned away from the woman only two feet behind him, pled desperately with his eyes: No!<br> <br>The father recalled a conversation he and I had had only weeks before about why we&#x2019;re often so reluctant to simply obey God when he offers us unexpected or inconvenient assignments. This one seemed to qualify on both counts.<br> <br>Nevertheless, he invited her to get in the car and they went off to the grocery store. As they were loading the bags in the trunk, the father made the mistake of asking if there was anything else she needed. Reluctantly, the woman mentioned that she also had a prescription for medication she couldn&#x2019;t afford. So of course more of the ATM cash disappeared at the pharmacy.<br> <br>When the father offered to drive her and her groceries home, she was both surprised and grateful. She sat quietly in the backseat for most of the trip, but as they neared her home, she asked, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Christians, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We are,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought so. Just before I saw your car at the ATM, I was sitting on the bench at the bus stop and I asked Jesus to send me a Christian.&#x201d;<br> <br>As father and son pulled away from the old woman&#x2019;s house, the son asked a million questions, and the father realized that more had gone on than simply meeting another person&#x2019;s needs. His obedience had created a teachable moment. The son wasn&#x2019;t convinced that this had been the smartest thing his dad had ever done, but he was at least impressed with his father&#x2019;s spontaneous generosity and willingness to obey God.<br> <br>Almost all of us have done similar things from time to time: random acts of grace and generosity. They make us feel alive, don&#x2019;t they? That&#x2019;s because they give us a taste, a glimpse, of what we were really created for.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s like one of those ads on TV for a new car that they&#x2019;ve not yet released. They&#x2019;re teasing us, tempting us with flashing images as the new model passes through stands of trees, reflected in mirror-smooth lakes. The maker wants to whet our appetites.<br> <br>Your maker does, too. And if you ignore your comfort zone long enough to jump at the chance to be spontaneously generous and kind when God throws those opportunities your way, you may be prompted to ask, What if I could actually live like this every day? Not just giving away money, but giving myself away? What if these spontaneous acts of kindness and obedience happened so frequently, maybe a dozen times a week, that they become as natural and habitual as brushing my teeth or checking my email?<br> <br>The answer is that you&#x2019;d be experiencing the natural consequence of a surrendered life. And in the divine math of the kingdom, when we give ourselves away, we actually discover our true purpose for life&#x2014;the normal Christian life.<br> <br>If you do, your legacy will be a string of a thousand stories, just like these:<br> <br>A woman stood in the checkout line at the supermarket. The poor woman right in front of her, the one trying to corral three small children, was having a meltdown. It was every young mother&#x2019;s nightmare and then some.<br> <br>One of her children was standing, runny nose and all, in the now-empty shopping cart; another was wailing at around a hundred decibels and hugging mom&#x2019;s leg like it was a tree in a hurricane; a third had run off somewhere. Meanwhile, the frantic young mom&#x2019;s only credit card had been denied. She&#x2019;d dumped half the contents of her purse onto the grocery belt and was desperately pawing through the clutter of keys, crumpled receipts, makeup, and baby gear, trying to find enough cash to pay for the groceries, now bagged and ready. Like any good mother, she was also scanning the area for her missing son, in full panic mode.<br> <br>The unfortunate mom appeared to be in her early thirties, but time and life had not been gentle. The lines on her face, the limp strands of hair now straggling across it, and the cheap clothes she wore screamed poor&#x2014;poor financially and poor in spirit. If to such belongs the kingdom of heaven, in the next life she might be queen. But right now, hope for anything other than day-to-day survival had fled; hers was the face of desperation. Suddenly she slowed and stopped, both hands in the pile of purse contents on the checkout counter, eyes staring blankly downward at nothing, as if she had reached the end of her energy and of whatever momentum had been carrying her forward.<br> <br>The woman behind her who&#x2019;d been watching quietly spoke. &#x201c;Here, this ought to take care of it.&#x201d; She handed the clerk her credit card. The clerk looked from the credit card to the startled young mother. Neither seemed to know what to do next.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to do that,&#x201d; the mother said, swiping the hair out of her face. She looked even more embarrassed than before. Finding her drive once again, she resumed clawing through the pile from her purse.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; said the woman in line, discreetly enough to preserve what little was left of the mother&#x2019;s dignity. &#x201c;Please let me do this for you&#x2014;and for your children.&#x201d; She motioned for the clerk to complete the transaction. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll watch your groceries if you want to go find your son.&#x201d;<br> <br>The young mother was clearly struggling to understand what had just happened, but with that reminder, her mothering instincts kicked in. After a quick, embarrassed &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; she hurriedly dumped her stuff back into her purse and, with one child in her arms and the other clasped tightly by the hand, rushed off in search of her lost lamb.<br> <br>A few moments later, when the Good Samaritan saw the mother returning, family restored, she turned to leave.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop, please,&#x201d; called the young mother. Dragging her three still-squabbling children up to the cart of bagged groceries, she said to the woman standing next to them, &#x201c;Thank you so much, but have we met?&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman smiled. &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t recall seeing you before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But then why did you offer to pay for my groceries?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a Christian,&#x201d; the woman said simply. &#x201c;As I stood behind you, I sensed that God was telling me to pay for your groceries, so I did. Simple as that. Since everything I have belongs to God anyway, he paid your bill&#x2014;not me. Just thank him, if you&#x2019;d like. I hope you have a great day.&#x201d; And with one last smile, the woman turned and left.<br> <br>In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. (Matthew 5:16)<br> Simple Obedience Isn&#x2019;t Always<p></p> <br>In the two stories I&#x2019;ve shared, God gave directions to his children&#x2014;and they listened and obeyed. Simple as that. But it&#x2019;s not really that simple, is it?<br> <br>At least, it never has been for me.<br> <br>Even though I&#x2019;ve been serious about following Jesus for more than thirty years now, there have been times when I&#x2019;ve been just plain worn-out from life, difficult relationships, even from ministry, from being handed one more &#x201c;opportunity to serve&#x201d; because &#x201c;you&#x2019;re so good at it.&#x201d; And worn-out from trying desperately, at the same time, to stomp out these little brushfires of sin that I knew were holding me back, denying me the joy of my salvation. So, periodically, I would give myself a breather and take a break from serious obedience. I just wanted to veg!<br> <br>Using some internal moral-actuarial table, I would credit myself for church attendance, having personal devotions, giving, and generally being a good guy&#x2014;with offsetting debits for sin. In my mind, and my arrogance, I assumed I had a positive balance compared to most other Christians I knew. I figured I had plenty of carry-forwards.<br> <br>So I&#x2019;d spend a few months waiting around for the Holy Spirit to do what I couldn&#x2019;t (and maybe didn&#x2019;t even really want to, at that time), ignite the fire once again. And that was fine with me. That way I could lay the responsibility for my lukewarm spirituality at his feet; it&#x2019;s up to God to jump-start my spiritual life. I wanted a Road to Damascus experience. Until I got it, I was content to sit out a few innings&#x2014;just happy to be on the team.<br> <br>Those grand epiphanies rarely came. What frightened me more than anything was being spiritually flat for so long that after a while I&#x2019;d get used to it. It scared me to think that I might end up like so many I&#x2019;d known, whose central purposes in life appeared to be killing time pleasantly in warm places, doing a little volunteer work, oh, and of course going to church.<br> <br>Nobody wakes up one morning and makes the decision to be a lukewarm, religious Christian. So, I have a theory. I think we Christians who were once on fire for God often slowly and unconsciously drift toward religious activities, even good ones, because they&#x2019;re relatively convenient and culturally acceptable forms of obedience. It&#x2019;s a faith we can schedule into our busy lives&#x2014;worship at 10:00 a.m., drop our offerings in the plate, Bible study on Tuesdays, volunteer on Wednesdays at 7:00 p.m. It&#x2019;s a spirituality that we can measure ourselves and others by&#x2014;familiar and predictable, and it still leaves 95 percent of our waking hours for ourselves. Just the ticket for a user-friendly religion.<br> <br>Eventually I would come to my senses and spend a few days alone doing serious business with God, crying out to him to forgive my spiritual laziness. And he would, of course. But it troubled me that he had to. Was this a cycle to which I had to simply resign myself?<br> A Rule of Life<p></p> <br>Then a dozen years ago I was introduced to a rule of life so stunningly simple it was almost embarrassing. It gave me a place to begin again when I found myself spiritually on the bench. Its power is in its simplicity, and yet it gets straight to the heart of what it means to actually follow Jesus. It has become the rule for my life, just as it had for the followers of Jesus you met in the preceding stories.<br> <br>A rule of life is just what it sounds like: a motto, vow, or promise which, if lived out courageously and consistently, at some point changes us from who we are to the men and women we truly long to become. Rules of life have been around as long as there have been people who longed to live lives pleasing to God. Samson, St. Francis of Assisi, the Moravians, Billy Graham, and others have all adopted them&#x2014;simple statements of how they believe God intends them to live. Those rules become a compass, helping guide those who follow them to true spiritual north.<br> <br>The 10-Second Rule is a rule of life. In living by it, you&#x2019;ll either become a far more serious follower of Jesus or realize fairly quickly that you just don&#x2019;t have much interest.<br> <br>Obviously, I have no idea where you are on your faith journey. You may still be kicking tires spiritually, still checking Jesus out. Or maybe you&#x2019;re disappointed with God right now because he hasn&#x2019;t yet delivered you from the wreckage you or others have made of your life. Perhaps you&#x2019;ve been a Christian all your life but have resigned yourself to &#x201c;this is as good as it&#x2019;s going to get.&#x201d; Please don&#x2019;t!<br> <br>What is it that causes one believer in Jesus to become a passionate follower, someone whose life significantly impacts other lives, and another to settle for a life of beige Christianity?<br> <br>A decision.<br> <br>A personal decision to be far more serious about being like Jesus, whether anyone else in your life is or not.<br> <br>Jesus&#x2019; call to come follow me hasn&#x2019;t changed in two thousand years. The Rule isn&#x2019;t a new command. It&#x2019;s simply an easy-to-understand, to-the-point reminder of what it actually means to be on this journey with Jesus, to be led by him day by day, minute by minute&#x2014;or even in the next ten seconds!</p><h2>Complete Norwegian Beginner to Intermediate Course: Learn to read, write, speak and understand a new language (Teach Yourself)</h2><p><b>Do you want to develop a solid understanding of Norwegian and communicate confidently with others?</b><br> Through authentic conversations, vocabulary building, grammar explanations and extensive practice and review, <i>Complete Norwegian</i> will equip you with the skills you need to use Norwegian in a variety of settings and situations, developing your cultural awareness along the way.<br> <br> <b>What will I achieve by the end of the course?</b><br> By the end of <i>Complete Norwegian</i> you will have a solid intermediate-level grounding in the four key skills - reading, writing, speaking and listening - and be able to communicate with confidence and accuracy. <br> <br> <b>Is this course for me?</b><br> If you want to move confidently from beginner to intermediate level, this is the course for you.

While other girls played with toys and braided their hair, Georgia practiced her drawing and let her hair fly free. As an adult, Georgia followed her love of art from the steel canyons of New York City to the vast plains of New Mexico. There she painted all day, and slept beneath the stars at night. Throughout her life Georgia O'Keeffe followed her dreams--and so found her way to become a great American artist.<br></p><p>"When I was twelve years old, I knew what I wanted--to be an artist." So begins <i>My Name Is Georgia</i>, Jeanette Winter's lovely picture-book portrait of American artist Georgia O'Keeffe. It is a portrait of a strong-minded young girl who liked to play by herself, dress differently from her sisters, and let her black hair fly when others wore braids. And it is the portrait of an artist who lived to be 98 years old, letting the world see things as she saw them through her remarkable paintings. This small book--with sparse, carefully chosen prose--traces O'Keeffe's life through her schooling in Chicago and New York, and her first trek to Texas: "And I painted the sunset and the sky and the wonderful loneliness and emptiness of the place. I painted day and night." From there she experienced the "canyons of steel" of New York City, "where other artists lived," then it was off to the New Mexico desert. Winter does an exquisite job of reflecting an artist's creative life--how she wanted others to see flowers the way she saw them, how she painted them "BIG, so people would notice." The author's illustrations, perfect squares on white pages with the occasional cloud or bird drifting out of the lines, make this small, powerful tribute shine. (Ages 6 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i><p>JEANETTE WINTER has written and illustrated many books for children, including MAMA, The Librarian of Basra, Calavera Abecedario: A Day of the Dead Alphabet Book, My Name Is Georgia, and Josefina.

It happened a lot that year. BYU led the nation in offense, scoring more than five hundred points, thanks to the arm of two-�time all-�American quarterback Jim McMahon. On his way to setting seventy NCAA passing records, McMahon had put Provo, Utah, on the college football map.<br><br>Twenty-�year-�old Sharon Smith hardly noticed. But one evening that fall she was outside her apartment when a rugged-�looking guy with wavy, shoulder-�length hair approached. He introduced himself as Mike Leach, a twenty-�year-�old junior from Cody, Wyoming. He lived in the apartment complex next door. They even used the same laundry room. Turned out they had been neighbors for months.<br><br>Smith was surprised they had never crossed paths. But Leach traveled a fair amount. He was a member of BYU&#x2019;s rugby team.<br><br>She was intrigued. Leach didn&#x2019;t look like a BYU student. For one thing, his hair was too long. It should have been above his collar, according to BYU&#x2019;s honor code. But Leach ignored the rule. That got him repeatedly summoned to the dean&#x2019;s office. Still, Leach didn&#x2019;t cut his hair. He didn&#x2019;t talk like a BYU student either. His vocabulary was a little more colorful. So was his upbringing. He grew up in Wyoming with boys who spent Friday nights popping beers and getting in fistfights. Ranchers wearing sidearms would come into town for lunch at the local diner. Gunsmoke reruns were all the rage. Marshal Dillon was Leach&#x2019;s boyhood hero.<br><br>Smith had met lots of guys at BYU. None was as authentic&#x2014;�or as funny&#x2014;�as Leach. They ended up talking until after midnight, and she accepted his invitation to go out the following night.<br><br>Their first date was a meal at an A&amp;W restaurant in Provo. That&#x2019;s when college football entered the picture. Over hot dogs and a couple cold root beers, Leach started talking about coaching. His idol was BYU&#x2019;s head coach, LaVell Edwards. During Leach&#x2019;s freshman year he had entered his name in a drawing and won season tickets on the forty-�yard line. From that perch he began studying BYU&#x2019;s offensive scheme: a controlled passing game with somebody always in motion before the snap; lots of receivers running a combination of vertical routes and crossing patterns; throwing to the backs in the flat. Edwards&#x2019;s innovative system was a forerunner of the West Coast Offense ultimately popularized by Bill Walsh in the NFL. But at the college level in the early 1980s, no defensive coordinator in the country had figured out how to stop it.<br><br>To the casual fan BYU&#x2019;s system looked pretty complicated. And to a certain extent, it was. But Leach had figured out that the genius of Edwards was the way he packaged his plays. He used an endless number of formations to disguise about fifty basic plays. That made it easy for the offense to memorize and difficult for defenses to recognize.<br><br>Smith had no idea what Leach was talking about. But one thing was obvious to her: the guy sitting across from her sipping root beer through a straw was no casual fan of the game. He wasn&#x2019;t some armchair quarterback either. In high school Leach had started a &#x201c;coaching&#x201d; file, filling it with newspaper clippings from the sports pages and schematic ideas he scribbled on loose sheets of paper. By the time he got to Provo and could watch LaVell Edwards up close, he was mapping out his future. &#x201c;BYU had a state-�of-�the-�art offense,&#x201d; Leach said. &#x201c;The best in the country. I started studying it very closely. LaVell Edwards had a major impact on me.&#x201d;<br>After one date with Leach, Smith never saw anyone else. &#x201c;Of all the people I dated at BYU, he was the only guy who knew exactly what he wanted to do,&#x201d; Smith said. &#x201c;He told me right away that he knew he was going to be a lawyer or a college football coach. I found it very attractive that he had a plan and was very confident about achieving it.&#x201d;<br><br>Never mind that Leach had never played college football and his only coaching experience was as a Little League baseball coach back in Wyoming. Smith wasn&#x2019;t worried. &#x201c;He could analyze the game and the way coaches were coaching, and he had it in his mind that he could do it better at a young age,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Confidence is a very attractive feature.&#x201d;<br><br>In June 1982, Mike and Sharon were married in St. George, Utah. After BYU, they moved to Southern California, and Mike attended law school at Pepperdine. But just before he got his law degree, he posed a practical question to Sharon: &#x201c;Do you want me to come home miserable and making a lot of money or come home happy and not earning as much money?&#x201d;<br><br>She told him that being happy was more important than making a lot of money.<br><br>Leach didn&#x2019;t bother taking the bar exam. Instead, he and Sharon headed to Alabama so Mike could attend the U.S. Sports Academy. After he obtained his master&#x2019;s, they returned to California, and Mike talked his way into a part-�time assistant&#x2019;s position with the football team at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, then a Division II school. The fact that Leach had a law degree intrigued the head coach enough to offer him a job helping out for $3,000. Sharon figured that was a monthly salary. But it was $3,000 for the season.<br><br>With a one-�year-�old baby, the Leaches moved into campus housing. Their bed was a floor mattress. They didn&#x2019;t own a television. Their motto was &#x201c;Opportunity trumps money.&#x201d;<br><br>After one season, the head coach at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo predicted that Leach would develop into a big-�time college football coach. Over the next decade Mike and Sharon crisscrossed the country, taking coaching jobs at College of the Desert in California, Iowa Wesleyan and Valdosta State. Leach even spent a year coaching football in Finland. He held every position from offensive line coach to linebacker coach to quarterback coach. He even served as sports information director and equipment manager at one school. And when all the other coaches left at the end of the day, Leach stayed behind to watch film&#x2014;�always alone, sometimes until dawn&#x2014;�night after night.<br>For the first fifteen years of marriage, Sharon made more money doing clerical work and miscellaneous jobs than Mike made coaching. They were happy but broke. Plus, they were up to three kids with a fourth on the way. Then things changed in 1997. Kentucky&#x2019;s head coach, Hal Mumme, hired Leach as his offensive coordinator. Suddenly Leach jumped from small schools in the middle of nowhere to the SEC, the best conference in college football. His offensive scheme&#x2014;�referred to as &#x201c;the spread&#x201d;&#x2014;�would be tested against Florida, Alabama, Georgia, LSU, Tennessee and Auburn.<br><br>Working under Mumme and drawing from the BYU offense he&#x2019;d studied in the early 1980s, Leach added new wrinkles that opened up the field even more, making it easier for his quarterback to throw into open passing lanes. &#x201c;I spend more time trying to make my offense easy for the quarterback to memorize than anything,&#x201d; Leach said. &#x201c;I want to make it as simple as possible because I want guys to trigger as quick as possible. The key isn&#x2019;t finding good plays. The key is packaging.&#x201d;<br><br>One of the most revolutionary aspects of Leach&#x2019;s system was spacing the offensive linemen three feet apart. At first glance, it appears to give pass rushers a clear shot at the quarterback. But the result was fewer sacks and cleaner passing lanes for the quarterback. The SEC had never seen anything like it. In Leach&#x2019;s first season as offensive coordinator, Kentucky upset Alabama and finished the year with the No. 1 offense in the country, led by quarterback Tim Couch. The following year Kentucky knocked off LSU; Couch threw for more than four thousand yards and went on to become the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. Meanwhile, Leach&#x2019;s offense set six NCAA records and forty-�one SEC records. The Wildcats had a winning record in the toughest conference in the country.<br><br>Coaches in the SEC weren&#x2019;t the only ones who noticed. Coaches from around the country&#x2014;�including Urban Meyer at Notre Dame, Tommy Bowden at Tulane and Mark Mangino at Kansas State&#x2014;�traveled to Kentucky to learn more about Leach&#x2019;s system. Even a number of NFL coaches made the trek to Lexington. The interest level was so high that Leach made an instructional video on the finer points of throwing and receiving techniques. It sold thousands of copies.<br><br>After two seasons at Kentucky, Leach accepted the position as offensive coordinator at Oklahoma. He was there less than one year before he got offered the head job at Texas Tech. The opportunity had some downside. It was 1999 and Tech was on academic probation for recruiting violations, academic fraud and unethical conduct. Eighteen scholarships were stripped from the football program between 1999 and 2001. Not only would Leach be competing against Texas, Oklahoma and Texas A&amp;M, but he&#x2019;d be doing it with eighteen fewer scholarships for his first three seasons.<br><br>There were other problems. Tech&#x2019;s graduation rates were among the lowest in the nation. Leach held two advanced degrees and had no interest in a football culture that ignored the importance of academics.<br><br>Plus, there was the unenviable task of replacing Tech&#x2019;s Spike Dykes, who had won more games&#x2014;�eighty-�two&#x2014;�than any football coach in the history of the school. In Lubbock, where football is right beside God in importance, Dykes was beloved.<br><br>Despite all this, Leach said yes. At thirty-�eight, a guy who never played college football was off to Lubbock to coach the Red Raiders in the Big 12.<br>Six years later, a cup of coffee in one hand and a remote control in the other, Mike Leach was alone in his office going over game film. Play. Pause. Rewind. Play. Pause. Rewind. Next sequence.<br><br>It was after midnight when he stood up to stretch his legs. He parted the blinds on his office window that overlooked the Texas Tech practice facility. That&#x2019;s when he spotted a shadow moving across the field. It was a human shadow. &#x201c;Who in the hell is that?&#x201d; he mumbled.<br><br>The facilities were locked, the lights off. The place was deserted. Leach wondered if it was a prowler. He headed downstairs to have a look.<br><br>Approaching the field, Leach spotted tiny orange cones. They were arranged in rows. Someone was darting in and out of them. Suddenly the figure came into focus.<br><br>&#x201c;Michael?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, hey, Coach.&#x201d;<br><br>It was Tech receiver Michael Crabtree, considered the top wideout in the country.<br><br>&#x201c;Michael, what are you doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got to thinking about the corner route,&#x201d; he said in between deep breaths. &#x201c;If I come out of my cut like this&#x201d;&#x2014;�Crabtree pointed his toes and jigged hard to the right&#x2014;�&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be open every time.&#x201d;<br><br>Impressed, Leach folded his arms and nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Crabtree continued, &#x201c;I set up some cones, and I&#x2019;m out here working on it.&#x201d;<br><br>Leach&#x2019;s eyes went from Crabtree to the cones and back to Crabtree. The most talented wide receiver in college football was alone in the dark. There was no ball. No quarterback. No position coach to tell him what to do. It was just Crabtree in his stance, doing starts and stops, running in and out of cones.<br><br>The truth was that Crabtree worked out alone at night a lot. He lived across the street from the practice complex and would sneak in after dark. &#x201c;I always worked on my game,&#x201d; Crabtree said. &#x201c;Coach Leach just happened to catch me that night.&#x201d;<br><br>Determined not to disrupt hard work, Leach turned and headed back inside without saying another word.<br><br>Leach and Crabtree had the kind of relationship that didn&#x2019;t require much talk. When Leach arrived in Lubbock six years earlier, Tech didn&#x2019;t land blue-�chip recruits like Crabtree. A star quarterback at David W. Carter High School in Dallas, Crabtree was also one of the top high school basketball players in the state. Bobby Knight offered him a basketball scholarship. And Texas, Oklahoma, Texas A&amp;M and LSU were all over him with scholarship offers to play football. Tech&#x2019;s facilities couldn&#x2019;t compete with those schools&#x2019;. And Leach&#x2019;s budget was a fraction of his rivals&#x2019;.<br><br>Still, Leach was winning with guys who had been passed over by the Longhorns and the Sooners and the Aggies. In Leach&#x2019;s first six seasons, Tech had gone 49-�28, appeared in six straight bowl games and finished in the top twenty in both 2004 and 2005. But the thing that really got Crabtree&#x2019;s attention was Leach&#x2019;s Air Raid offense. &#x201c;They threw the ball every play,&#x201d; Crabtree said. &#x201c;Leach had the whole program going. I said to myself, &#x2018;Man, if I go to Tech, it&#x2019;s gonna be on.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Tech indeed had the most explosive offense in the country when Leach started recruiting Crabtree in 2004. That year, Tech&#x2019;s football scores often looked like basketball scores. The Red Raiders put up seventy points against TCU. Then they put up seventy against Nebraska, marking the most points scored against the Cornhuskers in the program&#x2019;s 114-�year history. Virtually every Tech game was an offensive exhibition, and Leach&#x2019;s quarterbacks were leading the nation in passing year in and year out.<br><br>But Leach told Crabtree up front that he planned to play him at receiver, not quarterback. Crabtree had been the best athlete on his high school team, and&#x2014;�as is often the case for superior high school athletes&#x2014;�he got asked to play quarterback. But Leach saw in him all the raw materials to make a great receiver&#x2014;�breakaway speed, great leaping ability, big hands and fearlessness. He went as far as to tell Crabtree that he could see him playing wideout in the NFL.<br><br>Crabtree had never played receiver. But it didn&#x2019;t take much to convince him to switch. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to stay in college that long,&#x201d; Crabtree said. &#x201c;I wanted to get on to the NFL. If I played quarterback, I&#x2019;d be at Tech for five years. I figured if I played receiver at Tech, I would tear it up.&#x201d;<br><br>The chance to play receiver at Tech also made it easier not to choose Texas or Oklahoma. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to go to Texas or OU and just be another guy,&#x201d; Crabtree said. &#x201c;I wanted to go somewhere to make a name for myself. With Leach at Tech, I had a chance to take it to another level.&#x201d;<br><br>All he told Leach, however, was one thing: &#x201c;I want to score touchdowns.&#x201d;</p><h2>Ultimate Guide: Trimwork (Creative Homeowner) DIY How-to for Crown Molding, Chair Rail, Base Trim, Wainscoting, Casing, Built-Up Molding, and More; Trade Secrets and Best Techniques (Home Improvement)</h2><p><p><i>Ultimate Guide: Trimwork</i> shows how easy it is to enhance any home by adding decorative trimwork or molding&#x2014;the right way.

How can we stop it?</h2><p>&#34;The Obesity Epidemic: What caused it? How can we stop it?&#34; does what it says in the title - it answers those two critical questions. It takes you on the journey that the author, Zoe Harcombe went on to answer those questions and hopefully it will shock you as much as it shocked her. The starting point must be - when did The Obesity Epidemic start? The graphs and tables show a stunning increase in obesity levels at the turn of the 1980&#39;s and obesity literally takes off, like an aeroplane trajectory, from that point onwards. Obesity in the UK, as an example, increases almost 10 fold between the 1970&#39;s and 1999 from 2.7% to 25%. So what happened? The short answer is - we changed our diet advice. More accurately we did a U-turn in our diet advice. We used to believe (and our grandmothers still do) that bread and potatoes were fattening and we should put butter on our vegetables. We changed this completely to tell citizens of the &#39;developed&#39; world to base our meals on starchy foods and to replace nature&#39;s butter with man-made hydrogenated spreads. Coincidence or cause? The Obesity Epidemic takes you through the actual documents that changed our diet advice, most importantly why the advice changed and what is stopping us from changing the advice back. This is a journey through the landmark turning points in the history of public health diet advice and the impact that this has had on obesity - and all the accompanying modern illnesses: heart disease; cancer; diabetes and the lack of well being that the average human suffers today. If you currently believe that &#34;energy in equals energy out&#34; - be prepared to change your view, if you read this book with an open mind. If you think one pound equals 3,500 calories, you may be in for a surprise. If you assume that you will lose one pound for every deficit of 3,500 calories you create, you will see irrefutable evidence to the contrary. You will understand where five-a-day comes from and will hopefully revise your adherence to this marketing slogan afterwards. You will hopefully be shocked and appalled at the conflict of interest in the food and obesity industries. You may never drink fruit juice again. With 400 references and every fact backed up with sourced and presented evidence - this is the most informative book on the subject of obesity ever written. You cannot fail to learn a great deal and to have your thinking continually challenged in a highly engaging way. The research for this book changed everything the author held to be true - read with an open mind - it could do the same for you. Love it or hate it, you have to read it.</p><p>Zo� was the first pupil from her state school to graduate from Cambridge University, having won a scholarship to read mathematics/economics at this famous institution. What no one knew at the time was that, having been anorexic as a teenager, Zoe had developed bulimia before starting her studies at Cambridge. She sat in her historic room, overlooking Kings Chapel, stuffing her face with food and asked the million dollar question: Why do I overeat? When all I want is to be slim? So started over a decade of research into obesity, overeating and weight loss. During her 20 s Zo� experienced food cravings to rival any drug addiction and discovered that there are three medical conditions that cause these food cravings. And so her first book came about: Why do you overeat? When all you want is to be slim. Published in 2004, it continues to change the lives of people who read it. Since putting her own advice into practice, Zoe has lived craving free and a constant 8 stone for over 15 years. She no longer suffers from any of the conditions that cause insatiable cravings and she knows how to make sure that these conditions never return. Stop Counting Calories &amp; Start Losing Weight: The Harcombe Diet was published in 2008, to share the message with readers world-wide. By popular demand, a recipe book came out at the same time. Zo� has also appeared on TV and Radio and writes regularly for magazines and newspapers. Zo� is a qualified nutritionist with a Diploma in Diet &amp; Nutrition and a Diploma in Clinical Weight Management, but she is first and foremost an obesity researcher. She has also found that the majority of nutritional information currently being taught (to dieticians and nutritionists) is wrong and that all dietary advisors need to be far more challenging and far less accepting of what they are being told. Solving the obesity epidemic relies upon such people, who really do want to make a difference, questioning their founding beliefs in the way that Zo� has done. Zo� is sponsored by no one and has funded the last two years researching for and writing the book full time from savings. Conflict of interest is at the heart of the obesity epidemic and therefore true independence is essential to be able to honestly question and analyse the problem. In whose interests is it that the world things eggs are bad for breakfast? Who stands to gain if butter is demonised? Zo� s personal experience has also proved invaluable in this journey to have effectively done the Minnesota starvation experiment as a teenager provides an understanding that no text book can match. Researchers writing TCB1 Antagonism Exerts Specific Molecular Effects on Visceral and Subcutaneous Fat and Reverses Liver Steatosis in Diet-Induced Obese Mice . (Diabetes, April 2010) have no general understanding of obesity and likely have never even been on a diet or had first hand experience of the misery of overweight and hunger.

Beginning with Albers's&nbsp;time at the Bauhaus in Weimar and Dessau, the publication follows the artist to America and describes major themes of his work there as well as the importance of his frequent travels to Mexico.&nbsp;Paintings, prints, furniture, household objects, works in glass, photographs, and pre-Columbian sculptures are beautifully reproduced and discussed by a team of experts. The juxtaposition of Renaissance sculptures and icons with paintings by Albers underlines the intellectual and spiritual dimensions of his art, and Albers&#x2019;s influence on 1960s Minimalist art is also explored.<br><br> Including a comprehensive biography, the book convincingly demonstrates how this great artist transformed modern design by using line, color, surface, and space to challenge the perception of the viewer.</p><p>Accompanying the first retrospective publication on Josef Albers in more than thirty years, this handsomely designed and produced book shows how this influential pioneer transformed modern design and influenced modern art.<b>Heinz Liesbrock</b> is the director of&nbsp;the Josef Albers Museum, Bottrop.</p><h2>Confessions of a Yakuza</h2><p>This is the true story, as told to the doctor who looked after him just before he died, of the life of one of the last traditional yakuza in Japan. It wasn&#x2019;t a "good" life, in either sense of the word, but it was an adventurous one; and the tale he has to tell presents an honest and oddly attractive picture of an insider in that separate, unofficial world.<br>In his low, hoarse voice, he describes the random events that led the son of a prosperous country shopkeeper to become a member, and ultimately the leader, of a gang organizing illegal dice games in Tokyo's liveliest entertainment area. He talks about his first police raid, and the brutal interrogation and imprisonment that followed it. He remembers his first love affair, and the girl he ran away with, and the weeks they spent wandering about the countryside together. Briefly, and matter-of-factly, he describes how he cut off the little finger of his left hand as a ritual gesture of apology. He explains how the games were run and the profits spent; why the ties between members of "the brotherhood" were so important; and how he came to kill a man who worked for him.<br>What emerges is a contradictory personality: tough but not unsentimental; stubborn yet willing to take life more or less as it comes; impulsive but careful to observe the rules of the business he had joined.<br>And in the end, when his tale is finished, you feel you would probably have liked him if you'd met him in person.

"What do you want it for?" </p><p>"I'm going to use it here, so don't worry. I'll give it back to you right away." </p><p>He gave me the knife. I held one end of a bit of string I'd brought with me between my teeth, got hold of the other end with my right hand, and tied it around the little finger of my left hand. I pulled it as tight as I could. Then I chopped off the tip of the finger. The cook just stood there gawping, but it hurt too much for me to bother about him. I cut off one end of the clean white cotton of my bellyband, bound up the finger, then asked him for a sheet of paper. I wrapped the bit of finger in it, and left. I wasn't at all sure that cutting off a finger would be enough to make them let me off, but there wasn't any other way by now. So I set out for Makuta's place in a sort of what-the-hell mood. </p><p>When I called out in the entrance, a maid came out, and a young man with her. I introduced myself and said I'd come to apologize, and held out the finger, still wrapped in its piece of paper. </p><p>"Just wait there a second, will you?" the man said, and disappeared inside the house. I didn't know whether Makuta was in or not, but I could hear women talking at the back of the house. My hand by now was throbbing like hell, and my kimono was soaked with clammy sweat. </p><p>After a while the same man came out again and said, more politely than I'd expected, "The boss says he understands. Now will you please leave?" </p><p>"I see," I said. "I'm much obliged." And I bowed and left. </p><p>It all went off so simply that I felt kind of let down. After that, I went straight back to Asakusa. On the way, I kept wondering why he'd made so little fuss, but I couldn't make any sense of it. So I assumed my boss must have done the apologizing for me. The boss was back in town by then. He glanced at me when I showed up, and said, "Mind you take yourself a bit more seriously from now on." And that was all he ever said about it.</p></p><h2>365 Days of Positive Self-Talk for Weight-Loss</h2><p>&#x201c;365 Days of Positive Self-Talk for Weight-Loss,&#x201d; is a powerful daily inspirational guide with positive self-talk messages for every day of the year.

I was a culinary student, in fish class. I&#x2019;m almost certain it was a Gulf oyster, and I don&#x2019;t think I liked it. I am <i>absolutely</i> sure it was a couple years before I ate my next oyster. It was not a very romantic start to my life in the oyster world.<br><br>Now, though, eating oysters is an almost daily occurrence for me. Whether I am tasting a new type or seeing how the seasons might change the flavor profile of some of the staple varietals at my restaurants, oysters are a huge part of my life, and they are a food that is truly special.<br><br>My connection with oysters grew over time. In the late 1990s I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and was a chef in a restaurant that sourced local foods as much as possible. We shopped at local farmers markets, and it was very common for farmers to drop by with freshly picked produce. Oysters became a big part of that time as well, and we exclusively served local Hog Islands from San Francisco&#x2019;s Tomales Bay. This is really when my relationship with oysters started being in a boat on Tomales Bay and having Hog Island&#x2019;s owner John Finger reach into the water, grab an oyster, shuck it, and then hand it to me to eat. It was one of those food moments that I will never forget. That day, I felt like I had discovered something.<br><br>Not long after that I opened a small seafood restaurant with the group I was working for. I expanded my oyster horizons, seeking out and tasting as many different oysters as I could get my hands on. I slowly learned that not all oysters are created equal they take time and care to grow, like most anything of quality. I found a few that I liked and kept the list small, but my knowledge and curiosity about oysters was growing.<br><br>In the early 2000s I moved back to Boston to open a seafood restaurant. That&#x2019;s when I met Skip Bennett and was invited to his oyster farm in Duxbury, Massachusetts. I took a few cooks with me, and we made our way to the farm where I was first introduced to Island Creeks. Skip and a few of his buddies were growing these amazing oysters, and meeting them was another moment of discovery for me. Skip&#x2019;s genuine passion for growing oysters and his love of the water made him easy to like, and I immediately admired him for his dedication to the craft. That day I had another chance to eat oysters pulled straight from the water, this time in my native New England, and my relationship with oysters began getting serious.<br><br>Even then oysters were not that common on restaurant menus; some places had them but few really put love into them. In that way, the evolution of the oyster bar is similar to that of the oyster itself. A look back at the history of the rise, fall, and rise again of the oyster shows the important part it has played as both a food source and a culinary ingredient. Only in the last ten years have oysters returned to their status as an iconic food that is more and more mainstream.<br><br>Now oyster bars are popping up in every major city in the world, and that interest in oysters has led to some great things. Fishermen who have made a living on the water for generations and have found it harder to catch enough fish to support their families have been able to turn to growing shellfish, like oysters. Some communities have taken it as a great opportunity to keep up working waterfronts they have known for generations. Chefs and restaurateurs, who have helped this revival by providing a place to serve oysters, as well as the people that eat them, all play an important role in that story.<br><br>Beyond their popularity, oysters do great things for the water they grow in, and even though I hate using the word sustainable&#x201d; to describe seafood, oysters are exactly that. Oysters, like anything that is farmed, face challenges from the environment, predators, the weather, and more. Watching how farmers have adapted and gotten better at the craft of growing has been an amazing experience. Skip Bennett is a great example of this; he is behind the famous Island Creek Oysters but has gone on to cultivate Row 34s and Aunt Dotty&#x2019;s, both from the same species but grown differently, giving them distinct flavors and appearances.<br><br>These days Skip and I have several oyster bars with our friends and business partners Shore Gregory and Garrett Harker. We source oysters from all over, and are always excited to taste a new one or hear the story of who grows them and how they got into it. I look at an oyster list like someone might approach a wine list: different geography, flavor profiles, and sizes. On our menus we list the grower along with the oyster, and we will talk endlessly about them to whoever will listen. Educating the staff on oysters is a big part of what we do at the restaurants, and I love hearing them talk to our guests as if they grew each oyster themselves. A couple days each year we put the staff on a bus and send them to Duxbury to experience the process firsthand. They always come back with a great appreciation for the farm and what it takes to grow an oyster. Someone always tells the story of how they ate their first oyster pulled right from the water just like I did all those years ago.<br><br>Each oyster tells a story, and as you look through this book, I hope your love affair, or maybe just an appreciation for these amazing creatures, starts and grows. Experience oysters the beauty of the shells, the effort that goes into growing them, and the dedication of those who serve them. With oysters, each step in the process is just as important as the next.<br></p><h2>My First Communion Bible (Burgundy)</h2><p>Your child's First Holy Communion is one of the most solemn and significant days in his or her life.

The BattleMech-King of the Battlefield-was born. BattleMechs reached their pinnacle during the golden age of the Star League. The fall of the Star League and the Succession Wars that raged for centuries afterward took their toll and by the Fourth Succession War, the technology employed on the battlefields was a mere shadow of what it once was. However, the discovery of the Helm Memory Core unlocked the technological potential to develop new BattleMechs and experimental technologies for the first time in centuries.</p><p></p><h2>When Turtle Grew Feathers: A Folktale from the Choctaw Nation</h2><p><p><strong>ForeWord Magazine Book of the Year Finalist and Oklahoma Book Award Finalist</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this Choctaw variant of Aesop's fable "The Tortoise and the Hare," master storyteller Tim Tingle reveals some unexpected twists and expands the cast of memorable characters to include a wild turkey, a colony of ants, and a cheering squad of Little Bitty Turtles.When Rabbit boastfully challenges Turtle to a race, he gets his comeuppance and Turtle gets a little assist from his winged friend, Turkey. </p><p>In the process, we learn why Turtle's shell is cracked and why you never see Rabbit racing Turtle today.

Except for a brief interest in becoming a veterinarian, (derailed by the unhappy combination of a dog, a porcupine, a pair of pliers and a lot of blood), she pretty much always wanted to keep on being an artist and writer. Stacey went through school as a fine artist, determined to be artistically pure, though starving. But fortunately she was given the chance to illustrate her first children's book shortly after graduation. She found that she loved the challenge of enhancing the story-telling power of a book with pictures, and conveying ideas or concepts without words. Since that first book, years ago, Schuett has illustrated many more. She's written a number of her own stories, which allows her the chance to build a book as both the author and illustrator. In addition to books, she is drawn to the requirements of more conceptual editorial and other kinds of illustration work.<br></p></p><h2>The Measure of a Woman</h2><p><i>The Measure of a Woman</i> helps women discover their strengths and learn from their weaknesses so that they can truly live in accordance with Gods Word. The world tells us one thing about beauty, but God's Word relates that beauty is something much deeper. When women learn how to be beautiful from the inside out, they gain respect and serve as examples to other women. Gene and Elaine Getz share these time-tested and proven guidelines that have led countless women to become living proof of God's love and grace. Here is a chance for even more women to discover the secret to biblical femininity.</p><p>Gene A. Getz is senior pastor at Fellowship Bible Church North in Plano, Texas. After serving as a Bible college and seminary professor, Gene became involved in planting Fellowship Churches. More than 30,000 people currently attend the Dallas churches he has started, while even more Fellowship Churches span the globe. Gene is the author of more than fifty books, including the bestseller The Measure of a Man, the host of the 15-minute daily radio program Renewal, and the director of the Center for Church Renewal. Gene and Elaine Getz reside in Texas.</p><h2>Ashley&#39;s War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield</h2><p><p>In 2010, the Army created Cultural Support Teams, a secret pilot program to insert women alongside Special Operations soldiers battling in Afghanistan. The Army reasoned that women could play a unique role on Special Ops teams: accompanying their male colleagues on raids and, while those soldiers were searching for insurgents, questioning the mothers, sisters, daughters and wives living at the compound. Their presence had a calming effect on enemy households, but more importantly, the CSTs were able to search adult women for weapons and gather crucial intelligence. They could build relationships&#x2014;<em>woman to woman</em>&#x2014;in ways that male soldiers in an Islamic country never could.</p><p>In <em>Ashley's War</em>, Gayle Tzemach Lemmon uses on-the-ground reporting and a finely tuned understanding of the complexities of war to tell the story of CST-2, a unit of women hand-picked from the Army to serve in this highly specialized and challenging role. The pioneers of CST-2 proved for the first time, at least to some grizzled Special Operations soldiers, that women might be physically and mentally tough enough to become one of them.</p><p>The price of this professional acceptance came in personal loss and social isolation: the only people who really understand the women of CST-2 are each other. At the center of this story is a friendship cemented by "Glee," video games, and the shared perils and seductive powers of up-close combat. At the heart of the team is the tale of a beloved and effective soldier, Ashley White.</p><p>Much as she did in her bestselling <em>The Dressmaker of Khair Khana</em>, Lemmon transports readers to a world they previously had no idea existed: a community of women called to fulfill the military's mission to "win hearts and minds" and bound together by danger, valor, and determination. <em>Ashley's War</em> is a gripping combat narrative and a moving story of friendship&#x2014;a book that will change the way readers think about war and the meaning of service.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;Rich storytelling. . . . Compelling. . . . In battle as in life, these women refuse to quit.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>Christian Science Monitor</em></p><p>In 2010 the U.S. Army Special Operations Command created Cultural Support Teams, a pilot program to put women on the battlefield alongside Army Rangers, Navy SEALs, and other special operations teams on sensitive missions in Afghanistan. The idea was that women could access places and people that had remained out of reach and could build relationships in ways that male soldiers in a conservative, traditional country could not. Though officially banned from combat, female soldiers could be &#x201c;attached&#x201d; to different teams, and special ops recruiting posters urged them to join the mission and &#x201c;become part of history.&#x201d;</p><p>In <em>Ashley&#x2019;s War</em>, Gayle Tzemach Lemmon uses exhaustive firsthand reporting and finely tuned understanding of the complexities of war to tell the story of a team of women handpicked from across the Army, Guard, and Reserve. At the center of this story is a friendship cemented by Glee, CrossFit, and the shared perils of up close combat. At the heart of the team is the tale of a dedicated and beloved soldier, First Lieutenant Ashley White.</p><p>Much as she did in her bestselling <em>The Dressmaker of Khair Khana</em>, Lemmon transports readers to a world they previously had no idea existed: a community of women called to serve a cause greater than themselves and bound together by danger, valor, and determination. <em>Ashley&#x2019;s War</em> is a gripping combat narrative and a moving story of friendship&#x2014;a book that will change the way readers think about war and the meaning of service. Indeed, in the wake of <em>Ashley&#x2019;s War</em>, all combat roles have been opened to women. This story is one part of the march toward equality in the armed forces.</p><p>&#x201c;An unforgettable story . . . will inspire you and remind you of the power that comes with defying limits.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sheryl Sandberg, author of <em>Lean In</em></p><p>Gayle Tzemach Lemmon is a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a contributor to <em>Atlantic Media&#x2019;s Defense One</em>, writing on national security and foreign policy issues. She is the bestselling author of <em>The Dressmaker of Khair Khana</em> and has written for <em>Newsweek</em>, the <em>Financial Times, International Herald Tribune, Christian Science Monitor</em>, CNN.com, and the <em>Daily Beast</em>, as well as for the World Bank and Harvard Business School.</p></p><h2>The Dust Bowl: An Interactive History Adventure (You Choose: History)</h2><p>Everything in this book happened to real people.

She has also written fiction novels and short stories, puzzles, and activities. When she isn&#39;t busy writing, Allison enjoys knitting, spinning, and reading good novels. Allison lives in Trenton, Tennessee with her husband, daughter, and a houseful of pets.The You Choose series continues to bring immediacy to historical situations by offering three story paths and anywhere between 19 and 24 choose-your-own-adventure endings, thereby illustrating how snap decisions could spell life or death for those living in hard times. The Dust Bowl is a standout, as it offers the intriguing choices of staying in Kansas to farm, leaving for California, or working as a government photographer (perhaps the one imagined to be responsible for many of the included period photos). Overall, the story paths in this series are nicely varied but short, so repeated attempts are necessary for these to make an educational impact.

It's Persian!I will be the first to admit that when it comes to the paranormal genre, I am very picky as to what books I will read. I think it has to be done in the right way in order for me to enjoy it because it can't overshadow the plot. With my fascination of the Salem Witch Trials and everything surrounding that part of our history, I knew that I would want to read The Witches of BlackBrook the moment I stumbled across the synopsis. Needless to say, this one hit every single one of my requirements and then some. I was utterly consumed and unable to put this incredibly well-written novel down!<br><br>"Together remain, and from fighting refrain, as the bond you share, time will not wear. So mote it be."<br><br>As a female, I adore a good, strong heroine, but to have a book that was all about female empowerment and the spirit of a woman was incredibly special. It's so rare to see a novel these days where the female steals the show, but Witches of BlackBrook really did just that. There was a small bit of romance, but the hero never outshone what the females could do. The main component is the bond of sisterhood; one that, no matter what, would survive through space, time, and any circumstance presented to these special sisters.<br><br>"Transported across time and space, she saw herself, Kara, and Kenna together, then watched as they shifted from one life to another, their faces different but their souls the same. Bound by the same energy each and every time, drawn by the heart but forced to remain apart."<br><br>The book takes place mainly in modern day times, but it also highlights scenes in the Salem Witch Trials period. There was something very unique and special with the way that Thawer chose to do this. It enhanced the story by bringing a deeper understanding of the relationship between the characters, but also of their current desires. I felt that the plot was original and twisty with things I didn't really predict happening. The paranormal element was sheer perfection and left this reader wanting more and more.<br><br>"Trin opened herself in that moment, heart and soul, and knew in an instant what they needed to do."<br><br>Overall, The Witches of BlackBrook was a grand slam for me. I was so enchanted by this spellbinding tale of hope, love, and a bond that can't be broken. There was something special about it and I honestly think it had something for all different types of readers. Whether you're into romance, historical, paranormal, new adult, etc. the author effortlessly weaves so many elements together to create a flawless experience for whoever picks it up. If you're looking to be enchanted and escape your mind for a couple hours, I highly suggest picking up The Witches of BlackBrook and diving on in! ~ Prisoners of Print</p><h2>The Demigod Files (Percy Jackson)</h2><p>Percy Jackson : The Demigod Files (Movie Tie-in)<br>In these top-secret files, Rick Riordan, Camp Half-Blood<br></p><p>Rick Riordan is an award-winning mystery writer.

This book can be used by parents, caregivers, teachers and/or health professionals who may have specific concerns about a child, or who simply wish to 'check in' to see how their child is fairing, and is an ideal addition to their 'toolkit'. I strongly suggest using this book over a number of sessions, working through it slowly and at the child's pace; ensuring they have sufficient time to respond. This book should be thought of as a series of stimuli designed to initiate discussions about the child's feelings. It is NOT a series of questions that must be answered in a linear way. Be prepared to stop and listen to the child and be flexible in the use of this book. It is also important that the adult is an active listener, i.e. taking the time to 'hear' what the child may be trying to convey. Children, particularly young children, do not have the vocabulary or the experience to draw upon to express exactly how they are feeling. This book has been designed to assist parents, caregivers, teachers and health professionals to help children understand what they are feeling and why they might feel that way, and to encourage them to talk about and describe their feelings and emotions in a non-pressured, guided and safe environment. The questions in this book are suggestions only. The adult who is using this book with the child needs to follow the child's lead in order to have a meaningful and authentic discussion. Talking about challenging emotions and accumulating a ready bank of 'feeling' words helps a child to better express their emotions rather than act them out through negative behaviours. Providing children with the skills and words to express their feelings is key to helping them move forward in a positive way. Before using this book with a child, please familiarise yourself with the entire contents, and read 'Using this Book' on pages 37&#x2013;39 so you are familiar with the questions and format.</p><p>Using this Book<br> The following ideas and questions are a guide only. In order to have an authentic discussion between the child and yourself, try to follow their lead. Encourage them to keep talking if they wish to discuss a particular aspect or section of the book. Also don't be afraid to ask your own questions, if they seem appropriate, regarding the direction the child is taking the discussion. This book is by no means rigid in its format. It has been designed to be flexible to suit the needs of the child and their own unique experiences. If there is silence after a question, allow the child time and space to say how they are really feeling. Try to avoid leading them; otherwise, there is a possibility they may answer in a way they believe you want them to respond. Ultimately, this book and the discussion it generates will give children the confidence to understand and express their feeling in their own unique way. &nbsp;</p><p>Options for use<br> 1. Read and discuss the complete book with the child over one session. This option can only work if the child is allowed to break when required and there is no pressure.<br> 2. Read and discuss the complete book with the child over a number of sessions, ie break the discussion when a pause organically develops.<br> 3. Revisit pages 16 to 25 with the child (the explanation on page 24 could be left out)&nbsp; if the complete book has been read at another time. This might be because you are worried about a child, and you are trying to find out what is troubling them. Note: these pages have a green boarder.<br> 4. Use pages 16 to 21 as a simple conversation starter with the child, ie 'checking in' with them to see if they are doing 'okay'.</p><p>Pages 34&#x2013;37 feature in-depth discussion questions to assist in the use of this book.</p></p><p>Jayneen (aka Jay Dale) is an experienced early years educator, author and publisher. She started her teaching career in the 1980s as a primary school teacher in rural Australia. She then moved to Melbourne and taught at a number of inner-city schools. In 1985, Jay had a change of career and became an educational editor and publisher. In the early 90s, Jay and her partner moved to Japan to work as English teachers. They lived and worked in Japan for over three and a half years. In fact, Jay's first daughter was born there. On returning to Australia, Jay began work as an educational author/packager. Since that time, she has authored and produced numerous award-winning titles for the educational publishing industry. Jay is also an accomplished children's book author, writing a number of titles for such literacy series as ZigZags, Totally Kidz, Deadly and Incredible, and a children's picture book series for Penguin. She is currently working with an educational publisher as lead author of a literacy series. Jay has written over 100 titles in that series. Jay is a mother of three daughters and was a school councillor at her local school for over seven years. This time spent in schools both as a teacher and a parent inspired her to ask the question of her community: 'What are we doing in schools to protect our children from unsafe touch?' When she realised very little was actually being done, she decided to use her authoring and publishing skills to write Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept to help parents, carers and teachers to broach the subject of self-protection and to encourage children to speak up. After the encouraging response to Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept, she realised there was a need to further build upon the idea of children not keeping secrets about unsafe touch. Jay participated in Protective Behaviours professional development and attended numerous conferences on the topic to educate herself in how to keep children safe and provide them with prevention education. Jay then went on to develop and publish a comprehensive Body Safety and Respectful Relationship Teacher's Resource Kit as well as writing several more children's books on the topics of Body Safety, consent, respect, body boundaries and gender equality. Jay's ongoing passion for the safety and empowerment of children continues today with new manuscripts and free-to-download Body Safety resources always in the wings.<br><br>Cherie graduated from Loughborough University in 2005, completing a degree in Illustration.

This book covers eight categories of perilous creatures, including "muscles, jaws, and claws"; "stings and poisons"; and "disease and destruction." Readers will learn about the animals' size, range, and diet, as well as their "danger factor." This intriguing, edifying book covers a wide array of well-known and obscure creatures (from the microscopic to the huge) that inhabit a variety of terrains. The seemingly harmless peacock mantis shrimp can "hammer its victim's shell to pieces" or "smash the glass of an aquarium," while the spitting cobra blinds its victim with poison before going in for the kill. The work also compares the pain of a sting, from mild discomfort to feeling like "getting your hand squashed in a revolving door."

Snow begins to fall as a blizzard quickly approaches. Little Mouse works hard and soon has a pile of twigs so large that he cannot possibly move it by himself. So he asks his friend Rabbit, but the two of them are too weak to make the stash budge. The friends ask Fox, who lends his sled, but all three realize that they are going to have to ask big, strong Bear for help. With the snow now falling harder, the friends start to move the large pile, but disaster strikes, and they have to make a quick decision to stay safe in the storm. While the story of animals working together to move a heavy object has been told before, there is an extra element of adversity that these characters face, and they must collaborate and persevere to overcome obstacles. Themes of teamwork, selflessness, and persistence run through the narrative and will reach readers of all ages. The setting is enchanting and the illustrations so realistically rendered that they look almost like photographs of the forest in winter.

The character&#x2019;s substantial backstory was laid out in detail in the first book but is only briefly summarized here, allowing the authors to jump right into the story, in which Gideon, the former art thief and nuclear researcher turned secret agent, must try to defuse an explosive terrorist plot before time runs out. Gideon, an engaging fellow from the get-go, lives up to his initial promise, demonstrating an intelligence and resourcefulness that should endear him to adventure fans.

Heading into the 1940s, he crafted an entirely new division of the studio called the Character Model Department, which focused solely on the details of character development. This latest volume from famed Disney historian Didier Ghez profiles six remarkable artists from that department, sharing uncommon and never-before-seen images of their influential work behind the scenes. With vivid descriptions and passages from the artists' journals, this visually rich collection offers a rare view of the Disney artists whose work gave rise to many classic Disney characters, and who ultimately rewrote the future of character creation in animation.<br><br>Copyright �2017 Disney Enterprises, Inc.

Now renewables are overtaking fossil fuels, with wind and solar energy becoming cheaper and more competitive every year. Growth in renewable energy will further accelerate as electric vehicles become less expensive than traditional automobiles. Understanding the implications of the energy transition will prepare us for the many changes ahead.<br><br>This book is a primer for readers of all levels on the coming energy transition and its global consequences. Bruce Usher provides a concise yet comprehensive explanation for the extraordinary growth in wind and solar energy; the trajectory of the transition from fossil fuels to renewables; and the implications for industries, countries, and the climate. Written in a straightforward style with easy-to-understand visual aids, the book illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of renewable energy based on business fundamentals and analysis of the economic forces that have given renewables a tailwind. Usher dissects the winners and losers, illustrating how governments and businesses with a far-sighted approach will reap long-term benefits while others will trail behind. Alongside the business and finance case for renewable energy, he provides a timely illustration of the threat of catastrophic climate change and the perils of delay. A short and powerful guide to our energy present and future, this book makes it clear that, from both economic and environmental perspectives, there is no time to lose.</p><p>Bruce Usher is professor of professional practice and the Elizabeth B.

An impatient fellow (with a long, luxurious tail), Rabbit wants things when he wants them. And right now he wants snow&#x2014;the fact that it&#x2019;s summer notwithstanding. Fortunately (for him), Rabbit knows a magical chant that will bring the flakes. And no matter what the other animals think, he persists until finally the snow does fall. And fall, and fall. So much snow comes down that Rabbit has to climb a tree to escape it. But without the chanting, the snow melts, unbeknownst to Rabbit, who is freshly awakened from a nap. When there&#x2019;s no snow to step on, he falls, his tail gets caught in the branches, he leaves fur along the way, and when he turns around to assess the damage, there&#x2019;s his cotton tail. The telling is sprightly, and Newman&#x2019;s ink-and-watercolor artwork, which has the feel of Asian brushwork, makes an ideal companion. An appealing addition to folktale shelves.

Is the faith and practice of American Christians today more American than Christian? These are the provocative questions Michael Horton addresses in this well-received, insightful book. He argues that while we invoke the name of Christ, too often Christ and the Christ-centered gospel are pushed aside. The result is a message and a faith that are, in Horton&#39;s words, &#34;trivial, sentimental, affirming, and irrelevant.&#34; This alternative &#34;gospel&#34; is a message of moralism, personal comfort, self-help, self-improvement, and individualistic religion. It trivializes God, making him a means to our selfish ends. Horton skillfully diagnoses the problem and points to the solution: a return to the unadulterated gospel of salvation.

Is this a verse in support of baptizing children who make a profession of faith in Christ as most evangelicals have supposed? If it is, why is it that so many of the children we baptize grow up to show little if any fruit of having been genuinely converted? Why do so many walk away from Christianity once they gain independence from the home? In Do Not Hinder Them, author and evangelist Justin Peters presents a compelling biblical case that both the nature of children and the nature of salvation warrant extreme caution before we baptize children who have made intellectual assent to the basics of the Gospel. Do Not Hinder Them encourages parents to teach their children the Gospel but also provides strong biblical and theological reasons to wait until they are older before following through with baptism.</p><p>Justin Peters (M.Div., Th.M.

Using a unique companion approach that offers two books in one-a practical, reader-friendly book for parents and a fun workbook for kids-this solutions-oriented guide utilizes the cognitive-behavioral approach to therapy and integrates the parent in the child&#39;s self-help process. Research has shown that if left untreated, children with anxiety disorders are at higher risk to perform poorly in school, to have less-developed social skills, and to be more vulnerable to substance abuse. Covering the six most commonly occurring anxiety disorders-generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, specific phobias, social phobias, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder-this book gives kids and parents successful strategies for achieving relaxation, conquering worries, challenging faulty thinking patterns, developing positive self-talk, and facing one&#39;s fears.</p><p>Bonnie Zucker, Psy.D., is a psychologist specializing in the treatment of anxiety disorders and OCD in children and adults. She is in private practice in Rockville, MD, and is the author of "Anxiety-Free Kids" and "Take Control of OCD," and coauthor of "Resilience Builder Program for Children &amp; Adolescents."Through simple and effective tools, Zucker's book doesn't just help parents and children understand anxiety and find ways to overcome it, but also strengthens the interactive approach and family bonds that make them better for it. --Claire Nana, <i>Psych Central</i><br><br>This revised edition is a valuable addition to the selection of self-help books available to parents. With a careful application of the strategies and faithful adherence to the program sequence, this can be a welcome, home-based first step in addressing behaviors that have become dysfunctional for a child who suffers from anxiety-based disorders. --Hazel Buys, <i>Children's Literature</i><br><br>I think Zucker did a great job of taking standard CBT strategies and packaging them for kids. Actually, I think they would work for a lot of adults, who otherwise might struggle with CBT homework exercises. So I definitely recommend this book if you have a child who is dealing with anxiety of any kind. --Erica Berman, <i>Healthy Life Lessons</i></p><h2>C++ Pocket Reference</h2><p><p>C++ is a complex language with many subtle facets.

Spurgeon (1834-1892) was a British Baptist preacher who remains highly influential among Christians of different denominations, among whom he is still known as the "Prince of Preachers." He preached his first sermon, from 1 Peter 2:7, in 1851 at 16 and became pastor of the Church in Waterbeach in 1852. He published more than 1,900 different sermons and preached to around 10,000,000 people during his lifetime. In addition, Spurgeon was a prolific author of many types of works including an autobiography, a commentary, books on prayer, a devotional, a magazine, poetry, hymnist and more. Many sermons were transcribed as he spoke and were later translated into many languages. Arguably, no other author, Christian or otherwise, has more material in print than C.H.

She paused in her walk up the hill, blocked her eyes against the spring sun, and counted.<br><br>"'One for sadness, two for mirth,'" Maggie quoted the old rhyme about crows and ravens her mother had taught her. "'Three for marriage, four for birth; five for laughing, six for crying; seven for sickness, eight for dying; nine for silver, ten for gold; eleven for a secret that will never be told.'<br><br>"A secret," she whispered to the black Newfoundland dog by her side. She smiled as she thought of her father's warnings about <i>pishogues</i> -- superstitious foolishness. "Everyone in Bonnie Bay has a secret, I'll wager."<br><br>The cliff behind Maggie's house rose sharply. At the top it took on the shape of a face peering down into the harbor. Everyone in the little fishing outport called the cliff the <i>quidnunc.</i> Like a <i>quidnunc,</i> or busybody, the rock jutted its chin over the tops of the trees as if straining to see the folk of Bonnie Bay in the British Colony of Newfoundland.<br><br>Maggie Wells and her dog, Sirius, were climbing to the top of the <i>quidnunc.</i> Sirius lingered for a moment on Witch's Rock, a ledge on the hillside that overlooked the harbor.<br><br>"C'mon, Sirius," Maggie coaxed. "I know you'd love to plunge right into the ocean, but that water is too cold. And now there's a big iceberg in the harbor."<br><br>Sirius turned and trudged behind Maggie as she headed up the steep path. From the time he was a pup, Sirius had loved swimming and diving from the wharves along the waterfront. He was always happy to fetch things from the boat for Pa, or to work around the stages -- the long wharves of rough-hewn tree limbs where freshly caught fish were laid out to dry.<br><br>When they reached the top of the <i>quidnunc,</i> Maggie sat on the edge of the smooth-faced rock and carefully slid down to a wide, rocky ledge that was carpeted with soft moss. Sirius followed her cautiously. A thicket of sweet-smelling spruce concealed a small cave in the rocks. Sirius waited outside while Maggie crawled into the cave. She found an old baby blanket she had hidden there last fall and some shards of dishes she had used last year for a make-believe kitchen. The blanket was damp and musty, so she brought it out and hung it on a limb to air. I suppose twelve is too old to play copy house, Maggie thought. She set the dishes on a rock next to where Sirius was lying in the sun. "It's kind of sad to grow up, though," she whispered as she scratched her dog's ears.<br><br>Suddenly, an unripe berry plopped on her shoulder. Then another berry caught in her long brown braid.<br><br>"I know you're there, Vera," Maggie called, looking around.<br><br>A curly, blond head poked out from behind a rock on the ledge above. "I followed you and Sirius all the way up here, and you never even saw me." Vera made her way down to Maggie. Her impish grin hardly matched the prim dress and starched white pinafore she wore. It always amazed Maggie that anyone as mischievous as her cousin, Vera, could stay so spotless and neat.<br><br>"It's neither ladylike nor Christian to spy on people." Maggie often pretended to scold her cousin as if she were several years younger instead of only a year. "Have you seen the iceberg off Killock Rock Island? It looks just like a church with two steeples."<br><br>Vera scrambled back up to the top of the <i>quidnunc</i> and looked to the north, where the iceberg towered high above the cliffs, blocking the narrows where Bonnie Bay opened into the sea.<br><br>"It's like a fairy castle," Vera whispered, "with turrets and towers."<br><br>"No, it's a church," insisted Maggie, climbing up after Vera. "I wonder if the iceberg that sank the <i>Titanic</i> was as big as that."<br><br>"Probably bigger," said Vera. It had only been a couple of months since the sinking of the famous ocean liner off the coast of Newfoundland. It was the biggest news during the spring of 1912, and the girls couldn't stop thinking about the tragedy.<br><br>"I'll <i>never</i> go near an iceberg," said Maggie. "It's way too dangerous."<br><br>"Look down there on Witch's Rock." Vera pointed. "There's Tamar Rand looking exactly like a witch herself, with her hair all mops and brooms."<br><br>"Can she see us?"<br><br>"She's looking back at the meadow. I think she's watching her sheep." Vera backed away slightly as if to hide herself from the girl below.<br><br>"Oh, Lord," whispered Maggie. "I don't want her to see us when we go back, especially when we have Sirius with us. You know how the Rands hate dogs. Pa says they're trying to make a law that will ban dogs from this whole bay."<br><br>"What will you do with Sirius if the law is passed?" asked Vera.<br><br>"Pa says we'll have to send him off somewhere, but I have something planned, all right," said Maggie, nodding. "I won't let them take Sirius away from me."<br><br>Sirius, who had been dozing on the soft bed of spruce needles, looked up and wagged his tail.<br><br>Maggie wound her long braid until it sat like a knot on the top of her head, then let it tumble back down to her waist. She peered below to Witch's Rock. Tamar stood looking out at the sea, her long dress fluttering around her ankles.<br><br>"When we go back, we'll walk right by her," said Vera, drawing herself up tall. "Those Rands do not own the <i>quidnunc.</i>"<br><br>"But they do own most everything else around here," Maggie said. "Our dads fish for old Howard, so it would be best not to cause any trouble."<br><br>Howard Rand was the richest man in Bonnie Bay. He had a large herd of sheep, and owned more boats than any of his neighbors. Maggie's father and Vera's father, Maggie's Uncle Norm, worked as fishermen on one of Howard Rand's boats. It was the custom for the owner of a boat to divide the catch of fish with his men. Then the owner would take back some fish from each shareman to help pay toward the costs of running the boat. But old Rand was known to charge unfair costs to his men. That and his sour disposition made him the most disagreeable skipper in Bonnie Bay. However, he had the best boats and fishing gear, and most folks considered it a privilege to work for him.<br><br>Maggie climbed back down to the mossy ledge, with Vera and Sirius close behind. She folded her blanket, gathered her china, and crawled into the little cave. Maggie thought about the eleven black birds. <i>A secret that'll never be told.</i> "Remember, you must <i>never, never</i> tell anyone about this cave," she warned Vera, who had followed her inside. "This is our secret. Do you swear?"<br><br>Vera held up her right hand. "I swear," she said solemnly.<br><br>Maggie hid her blanket and dishes on a stone ledge inside the cave. Then the girls climbed up to the top of the <i>quidnunc</i> and onto the path that took them back to the village. Sirius lumbered along ahead of them, wagging his silky tail.<br><br>When they approached Witch's Rock, the girls were frightened by the sound of growling, snarling dogs. Sirius began to bark. Suddenly, a sheep darted out from the bushes, bolting toward the cliff where Tamar was standing. She turned and shrieked as two vicious dogs came after the sheep. The sheep lost its footing on the rocky soil and plummeted off the boulder into the churning water below.<br><br>Screaming, Maggie and Vera raced to the edge and looked down. Maggie could see the sheep floating in the water.<br><br>"Your dog frightened it!" screamed Tamar, her dark eyes blazing as the two strange dogs bounded out of sight.<br><br>Before Maggie could answer, Sirius ran to the edge of the cliff and pawed the air, first with one paw and then the other. Suddenly, he sprang off the rock and down into the sea.<br><br>"He'll be killed!" Maggie howled. She peered fearfully over the cliff edge. Sirius's big head was bobbing up and down as he swam toward the sheep. Grabbing hold of the sheep's fleece with his teeth, the dog dragged his heavy burden back to the shore.<br><br>"He saved the sheep," Vera said excitedly. "He dove from the cliff to save the sheep."<br><br>Tamar scrambled down the path to the beach. "If I had a gun, I'd shoot that dog."<br><br>Maggie and Vera followed her to where Sirius was sniffing the lifeless animal.<br><br>"It's dead!" Tamar said accusingly. She waggled a finger at Maggie. "You and that dog will pay for this, you can be sure."<br><br>"We don't even know those dogs that attacked your sheep," Maggie protested. "My dog tried to save it. He dove all that way into the water to bring it back."<br><br>"My poor little sheep. She was about to yean, and I would have had a little lamb." Tears streamed down Tamar's cheeks. "You'll be sorry!" Tamar shook her fist at Maggie and narrowed her eyes. Her sharp features made Maggie think of a witch. "I'll see to it something terrible happens to all of you!"<br><br>"That's a right awful thing to say, Tamar!" Maggie snapped. "You know perfectly well that Sirius is a good dog."<br><br>"I'm going back and tell my Pa," said Tamar. She ran up the path toward town.<br><br>"C'mon," said Maggie as she headed for the road. "Let's go home."<br><br>Sirius sniffed at the sheep again. His tail wagged slowly, then he turned and followed Vera.<br><br>"That Tamar is a terrible witch," said Maggie angrily, "unjustly accusing Sirius."<br><br>"I wonder what she's going to do?" Vera shuddered. "She scares me."<br><br>"Pa will take care of it," Maggie said confidently. "He'll make it right with old Howard Rand."<br><br>Pa and Ma Wells were at the kitchen table having four o'clock tea when Maggie stomped in breathlessly, Vera and Sirius at her heels.<br><br>"Ma! Pa!" she hollered without stopping to take off her shoes. "We're in a lot of trouble. Listen to what just happened."<br><br>Vera sat on the floor by the door and unbuttoned her black boots. "That witch, Tamar!" she spit out bitterly. "She's cursed us."<br><br>After Maggie and Vera had told their story, Pa asked, "Whose dogs chased the sheep?"<br><br>"I don't know," said Maggie. "One was black and the other was spotted. They're not Newfoundlands, like Sirius."<br><br>"Maybe they come from Whale's Gulch," Vera said.<br><br>"What will old Rand do?" Maggie grabbed her father's arm anxiously. "Will he shoot Sirius?"<br><br>"Of course not!" Ma burst out, her red-haired temper flaring.<br><br>"Probably the worst that will happen is that Rand will try to charge us the price of the sheep from my share of the fish," said Pa.<br><br>"At any rate, you can never tell till after," said Ma. "Try not to worry." She stroked Maggie's head and turned to Vera, who was still on the floor, leaning against Sirius. Ma shook her head. "Vera, don't sit there on the floor, maid. You'll get a draft. You don't look well. Are you all right?"<br><br>"I'm all right, Aunt Grace," said Vera, getting to her feet, "except I have a little headache."<br><br>"How long have you had a headache?" Ma felt Vera's head. "You're feverish, Vera. You should go home to bed."<br><br>"Probably all the excitement," said Pa with a wink at Vera. "That Tamar is enough to give anyone a headache."<br><br>"She cursed us." Vera shivered. "Just like a witch. She pointed her finger and said we'd be sorry." Suddenly, her face paled as she looked at something through the window.<br><br>Sirius stood up attentively, his head cocked.<br><br>Coming through the gate was Howard Rand, his ruddy face flushed with anger. Tamar was running behind him. "You shoot that dog, Papa. You show them they can't kill our sheep."<br><br>Maggie gasped. Old Rand was carrying a rifle!<br><br>Copyright � 2000 by Joan Hiatt Harlow</p><h2>The Loveliness of Christ (Vintage Puritan)</h2><p>This is a choice selection of the letters from Samuel Rutherford.

Discover Proven Strategies that can Help You Conquer Fear and Take Charge of Your Life! Are you one of the nineteen million Americans who suffer from anxiety-related problems? Don&#39;t lose hope! Take action today with techniques that have helped thousands of people overcome their anxiety and live full and satisfying lives. Now in this new, updated edition of his classic guide, Reneau Peurifoy, an internationally recognized expert in the field, incorporates the latest available information and research. He presents a step-by-step program of fifteen manageable lessons that you can use to: * Identify and reduce the sources of your anxiety * Minimize and manage stress more effectively * Discover relaxation and other methods to ease symptoms of anxiety * Recognize and change harmful modes of thinking * Learn how to stop worrying and avoiding things * Manage anger and build self-esteem * Avoid relapses and keep moving forward. You too can live a happy and healthy life that&#39;s free of... Anxiety, Phobias, and Panic.</p><p>Dr. Reneau Z. Peurifoy lives in Sacramento, California.Decades ago, when Peurifoy, a researcher and therapist, became interested in studying agoraphobia, not much information was available about the painful, self-imprisoning, psychological affliction. Victims of irrational fears avoid leaving their homes, driving alone, shopping and opening the door to the postman. Their families' finances and wellbeing suffer as well. Now, thanks in part to Peurifoy's immersion in the subject, anxiety related avoidance behavior such as social phobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder can be managed, if not completely eradicated in some cases. What makes this revised edition of his 1988 guide better than others on the topic is its range and accessibility. Explaining the complicated dynamics of the nervous system, including the brain, Peurifoy presents a practical, thoroughly informative manual in which he persistently encourages the reader to perform the recommended activities for the best results. Disabling panic attacks, the reader learns, arise from the crossed wires of a complex biological system. Panic symptoms experienced during one frightening event become linked with exaggerated thoughts and feelings, which themselves attach to other events. Using Peurifoy's guiding principles, the victim learns to sidestep conditioned behavioral and cognitive responses. Performing the appropriate lessons, the reader can improve lost self-esteem and assertiveness, manage anger and negativity, reduce perfectionism and regain the ability to move freely in the world. Peurifoy, it seems, has put his whole life's knowledge and work into this book, so that it benefits people with even simple anxiety. And he has given victims of acute anxiety, phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder real reason to hope. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was her mortal enemy, bringing only misery. She tilted her wings and flew headlong into the fading darkness, hoping to follow the night, praying day would not find her.<br> <br>She had been flying all night, soaring high above Asgard, dreading the upcoming First Day Ceremony.<br> <br>Orus, her raven companion, flew at her side and tried his best to keep up. But his wings were much smaller than hers, and despite his best efforts, he lagged behind. After the long night he was too tired even to beg her to turn back. All he could do was try to stay with her and help guide her through First Day.<br> <br>&#x201c;Freya!&#x201d; a voice called.<br> <br>Freya looked back and saw her older sister Maya soaring confidently behind them. Her own raven was flying closely at her side.<br> <br>&#x201c;Freya, stop!&#x201d; Maya called. &#x201c;Please land. We must speak.&#x201d;<br> <br>Orus forced more speed and caught up with Freya. &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; he gasped. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t fly much longer, and your sister is calling.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freya looked over at her companion and saw how exhausted he was. She hadn&#x2019;t been fair, forcing him to fly all night. Pulling in her wings, she descended and gracefully touched down in a field of golden grain. As she folded and settled her midnight-black wings onto her back, Orus landed on her shoulder. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t lose your temper with your sister,&#x201d; he panted softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank Odin I found you!&#x201d; Maya cried as she also landed and charged toward Freya. &#x201c;Mother&#x2019;s in a state. Everyone is searching for you. Where have you been all night?&#x201d;<br> <br>Freya used her sleeve to wipe away the beads of sweat from her brow. Now that she had stopped, she felt exhausted from the long flight. The muscles in her wings warned of the stiffness to come. &#x201c;I needed some fresh air.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can see that,&#x201d; Maya cried. &#x201c;But why didn&#x2019;t you tell anyone you were going? You could have at least told me!&#x201d;<br> <br>Freya dropped her head. &#x201c;I saw you dancing with some of the warriors. I didn&#x2019;t want to disturb you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know I would much rather spend time with you than dance.&#x201d; Maya softened her tone. &#x201c;Especially on the eve of your First Day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to do this.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her sister&#x2019;s pale brows knitted together in a frown. &#x201c;Do what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This! Today!&#x201d; Freya snapped. &#x201c;My First Day Ceremony and then going to the battlefield.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean? You&#x2019;ve been to the battlefields thousands of times. You&#x2019;ve spent all of your life there. The only difference is that today you will reap your first warrior.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freya sighed heavily. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I hate. The warriors and all of the killing and wounding. Thor and Odin may appreciate them, but I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Freya, stop,&#x201d; Orus warned.<br> <br>But she couldn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Humans are nothing but filthy, bloodthirsty monsters. I don&#x2019;t want to touch them or be part of bringing more of them here. Asgard would be much better off without Valhalla and its dead warriors.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can you say that?&#x201d; Maya cried. &#x201c;Valhalla is a wondrous place and a home to all the valiant warriors who have fallen in battle since the dawn of time! Those fighters have earned their place here. It&#x2019;s a great honor that we are the ones chosen to escort them. You should celebrate everything they&#x2019;ve achieved.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All they&#x2019;ve achieved is becoming good killers!&#x201d; Freya replied. &#x201c;And what does that make us when we reap them? We&#x2019;re even better killers!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We do not kill!&#x201d; her sister said indignantly. &#x201c;We reap; that&#x2019;s very different. We bring an end to their suffering and escort them home to Valhalla.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t want to do it,&#x201d; Freya responded as she turned away from her sister. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to touch a human or even talk to them. All they ever want to do is fight and kill.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maya started to preen the black feathers on Freya&#x2019;s folded wings. &#x201c;Freya, listen to me. Those are the old warriors from the early days when it was glorious to fight and die in battle. You haven&#x2019;t spent enough time at Valhalla to get to know the modern soldiers. You just go there, do what you must, and leave. If you took some time to actually speak with them, you&#x2019;d see they are different.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A warrior is a warrior,&#x201d; Freya insisted as she turned and pushed her sister&#x2019;s hands away. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re human, and I don&#x2019;t like them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can you be so judgmental? Trust me. Most modern soldiers don&#x2019;t stay in Asgard. They ascend to be with their families. You&#x2019;ll see today when you reap your first. Just talk to them. I think you&#x2019;ll be surprised.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But what if I don&#x2019;t want to?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Freya, listen to me. Reaping is what we do. You have no choice&#x2014;it is your duty to Odin.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freya looked at her sister and sighed. Maya was beautiful. All four of her sisters were, but Maya was exceptional. She was tall and lean with long flaxen hair. The skin on her sculpted face was unblemished, and she had the palest pearl-gray eyes in all of Asgard. Her wings were fine-boned with elegant white feathers lying neatly over each other. She was everything a Valkyrie should be, which was why most of the reaped warriors fell instantly in love with her.<br> <br>Compared to Maya, Freya, the youngest of the five sisters, felt like a plow horse. She wasn&#x2019;t as tall, beautiful, or graceful. Her wings were large and stocky. Their raven-black feathers always looked as if they could use a good grooming. Instead of pearl-gray eyes, Freya&#x2019;s were dark blue. And although she was the fastest flier in Asgard, it was always Maya who attracted attention.<br> <br>But for all their differences, Freya adored her older sister. Many times she had watched Maya with envy as she confidently approached the battlefields. Without a trace of hesitation, Maya reaped the warriors she was assigned and escorted them back to Valhalla.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you ever question what we do?&#x201d;<br> <br>Maya shook her head. &#x201c;We do as we are intended to do. As Odin tells us to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if we don&#x2019;t want to do it?&#x201d;<br> <br>Maya put her hands on her hips and tilted her head to the side. &#x201c;Sometimes I wonder if you&#x2019;re even my sister. How can you not want to be a Valkyrie? We are most respected in Asgard. Odin favors us above all others. It is an honor to do what we do. We escort the best warriors home.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sitting on her shoulder, Orus whispered into her ear, &#x201c;Stop arguing. Maya cannot understand. Don&#x2019;t condemn her for that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freya looked into the dark eyes of the raven on her shoulder. Orus was right. No one in Asgard could understand how she felt. At times she didn&#x2019;t even understand it. She hated humans, and nothing could change that.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said finally. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m nervous for today.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maya nodded and combed her fine fingers through Freya&#x2019;s wild, unkempt hair. &#x201c;Of course you are. C&#x2019;mon, let&#x2019;s get you ready for the ceremony&#x2014;before Odin sends out a Dark Searcher to find us.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Freya and Orus followed Maya and her raven back to Valhalla. Beneath them the Great Heavenly Hall was being prepared for her First Day Ceremony. This was to be the final ceremony for some time, as there were no Valkyries younger than Freya. Everyone in Asgard wanted this ceremony to be the best ever&#x2014;everyone except Freya.<br> <br>In the fields surrounding Valhalla, the reaped warriors who had chosen to remain in Asgard did what they were always doing. Fight. Thor, son of Odin and greatest warrior of them all, was among them, taking on hundreds at a time. Some called this training; Thor just called it fun.<br> <br>Looking down, Freya could see his bloodred cape billowing in the wind and wild reddish-blond hair blazing as he used his sword against the other Valhalla warriors. He could have used his hammer, Mj�lnir, but that wasn&#x2019;t fair. One swing of the enchanted weapon would literally blow all of the warriors away.<br> <br>The clanging sounds of sword upon sword rose up in the air as the fighters spent all day battling each other. Then when night fell, they would enter Valhalla together and drink, sing, and tell stories of their great victories, before preparing for the next day&#x2019;s battle.<br> <br>To Freya it all seemed so pointless. There were so many other things to see and do. Why these warriors should choose to fight, day in, day out, was something she couldn&#x2019;t comprehend.<br> <br>Freya and Maya veered away from Valhalla and flew over the beautiful buildings that made up the main city of Asgard and back to their home. It was a magnificent mansion standing alone on a hill, surrounded by gardens that turned into dense forests.<br> <br>The Valkyries always had the best housing, and as Freya&#x2019;s mother, Eir, was senior Valkyrie, she had the biggest, most opulent home&#x2014;second in size and beauty only to Odin&#x2019;s palace.<br> <br>Landing on the main balcony, they found their mother pacing the large, richly decorated living area. Shields and weapons from battles throughout the ages adorned the walls, and the floor was lined with sheepskin rugs.<br> <br>Eir was dressed in her shining silver armor. The feathers on her wings were groomed and bejeweled, and her ceremonial dagger hung at her waist. Her winged helmet sat on a chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Freya!&#x201d; Her ice-blue eyes blazed, and her white wings were half-open in fury. &#x201c;Where have you been? Do you realize the time? You will be late for your own First Day Ceremony! Odin will be in a rage.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mother, it&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; Maya said calmly. &#x201c;Freya and Orus went out for a quick flight and lost track of time. Odin need never know. If you tell him we&#x2019;re on our way, we&#x2019;ll be there shortly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It will take an age to get her prepared,&#x201d; her mother ranted. &#x201c;Just look at the state of her. She&#x2019;s filthy!&#x201d; She snatched up a comb and tried to drag it through Freya&#x2019;s tangled blond hair. &#x201c;It will take all day just to get this mess cleared. Not to mention your feathers. Just look at the state of them! I&#x2019;m amazed you can even fly&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mother, please,&#x201d; Freya begged. She caught the comb as her mother pulled it through a large tangle. &#x201c;I can do this. Just give me some time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For the life of me, I just don&#x2019;t understand how my own daughter could do this to me on this day of all days. Of all my children, you have given me the most trouble. Your sisters were dressed and ready to leave at sunup. They&#x2019;ve already gone to Valhalla to join the honor guard. Don&#x2019;t you realize how important this is? You are my youngest child and the last Valkyrie. Today, finally, you will join us in the reaping. It is a great honor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freya opened her mouth to protest, but her sister cut in. &#x201c;Of course Freya understands the importance. We all do. Just give us a moment to prepare, and we&#x2019;ll meet you at the entrance to Valhalla.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother remained unconvinced, but nodded as she reached for her winged helmet. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t keep Odin waiting long. You know how impatient he can be.&#x201d; Without a backward glance, she crossed to the balcony, opened her wings, and leaped off.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;Remember to bow when you approach Odin,&#x201d; Orus warned. Well preened, he sat on Freya&#x2019;s shoulder as they prepared to leave for Valhalla.<br> <br>Freya nodded her head nervously. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maya put the finishing touches to Freya&#x2019;s gold-and-white gown as she flitted around her. &#x201c;And try not to yawn when he gives his speech.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try. But why does he always have to talk for so long?&#x201d;<br> <br>Orus leaned closer to her ear. &#x201c;To hear himself speak!&#x201d; The raven cackled at his insult to the leader of Asgard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let Odin hear you say that,&#x201d; Maya warned, swatting at him. &#x201c;Orus, you should show more respect&#x2014;like my Grul.&#x201d; Maya reached up and stroked the raven at her shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to educate Orus, Maya,&#x201d; Grul teased. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s too thick to learn anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you calling thick?&#x201d; Orus challenged, cawing loudly and flapping his wings.<br> <br>&#x201c;You,&#x201d; Grul answered.<br> <br>As the two ravens cawed at each other, Maya held up her hand. &#x201c;Enough! When will you two finally get along?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Never!&#x201d; the ravens said as one.<br> <br>Freya reached up and stroked Orus&#x2019;s smooth black chest. &#x201c;Calm down. He&#x2019;s just trying to upset you before the ceremony.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s doing a fine job of it,&#x201d; Orus muttered. &#x201c;One of these days, Freya, I&#x2019;m going to show that Grul just how clever I really am. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Ignoring the bickering birds, Maya finished fastening a plain gold chain at her sister&#x2019;s neck. &#x201c;Oh, and try to look interested when Odin tells the story of Frigha.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no, not again,&#x201d; Freya moaned. &#x201c;Why does he keep telling us the same old story every time there is a First Day Ceremony? Surely, by now, we all know it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He tells it as a warning to all of us,&#x201d; Maya said. &#x201c;So no one forgets what he did to the one Valkyrie who defied him and ran away from her duties in Asgard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But we all know the story. There&#x2019;s no need to keep repeating it!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, but just show him some respect and try not to look too bored.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try.&#x201d; Freya inhaled deeply. &#x201c;So how do I look?&#x201d;<br> <br>Maya took a step back and surveyed her work. &#x201c;You look beautiful. Not even Mother could find fault. Your face is clean, hair combed and braided, and your feathers are sparkling.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freya grinned and opened her dark wings. Her sister had applied fragrant oils to the feathers, and now the black feathers glowed with rainbow iridescence.<br> <br>Freya looked to Orus. &#x201c;Well, what do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do,&#x201d; the raven said casually. He gave her a playful nip on the ear with his polished long beak. &#x201c;Just as long as they don&#x2019;t look too closely at your fingernails.&#x201d; He cawed in laughter and flew off her shoulder toward the balcony. &#x201c;Now hurry up, before they start the ceremony without us!&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Valhalla had been decorated for the ceremony with the most beautiful flowers that grew in Asgard. The high walls had been scrubbed; the spires that rose high into the air flew the colorful flags of the Valkyries. The numerous weapons adorning the many doors had been cleaned and polished, and all the grounds surrounding the hall had been groomed. There wasn&#x2019;t a thing out of place.<br> <br>Outside the great hall the warriors stopped fighting and gathered together along either side of the entrance to greet Freya. As she approached, they all bowed their heads.<br> <br>&#x201c;See, they&#x2019;re not so bad,&#x201d; Maya whispered as she smiled at them.<br> <br>Freya wasn&#x2019;t convinced. &#x201c;Just you wait. The moment we&#x2019;re inside, they&#x2019;ll go back to slaughtering each other in the name of amusement.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maya sighed. &#x201c;That is the afterlife they have chosen for themselves. Why must you condemn them for that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s foolish.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s their choice!&#x201d; Maya insisted.<br> <br>The girls&#x2019; mother appeared at the entrance. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re late,&#x201d; she chastised. &#x201c;Everyone is waiting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mother,&#x201d; Maya said. &#x201c;But doesn&#x2019;t Freya look beautiful?&#x201d;<br> <br>Their mother was much like Maya&#x2014;tall, elegant, and Odin&#x2019;s favorite Valkyrie. &#x201c;Yes, she does,&#x201d; she admitted, embracing Freya warmly. &#x201c;I am proud to welcome you into the sisterhood of the Valkyries. Come, my youngest daughter. Come and take your rightful place among us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freya stood directly behind her mother, while Maya took her position behind Freya. As they approached the wide doors of Valhalla, Maya donned her winged helmet and then placed a reassuring hand on her sister&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right behind you, Freya. Always.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grateful for Maya&#x2019;s calm presence, Freya reached up and gave Orus a stroke on the chest. &#x201c;Well, this is it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good luck,&#x201d; the raven whispered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother led them into Valhalla. Its high arched ceiling rose far above her head, and the shields of countless centuries adorned it...</p><h2>What We Do in Church: An Anglican Child&#39;s Activity Book</h2><p>The wonderful sights, sounds, and smells of the Anglican liturgy can engage the imagination of young children and draw them into enthusiastic worship.

Desperate to beat the Russians into space, NASA put together a crew of the nation&#x2019;s most daring test pilots: the seven men who were to lead America to the moon. The first into space was Alan Shepard; the last was Deke Slayton, whose irregular heartbeat kept him grounded until 1975. They spent the 1960s at the forefront of NASA&#x2019;s effort to conquer space, and <i>Moon Shot</i> is their inside account of what many call the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest feat&#x2014;landing humans on another world.&nbsp;Collaborating with NBC&#x2019;s veteran space reporter Jay Barbree, Shepard and Slayton narrate in gripping detail the story of America&#x2019;s space exploration from the time of Shepard&#x2019;s first flight until he and eleven others had walked on the moon.</p><p><b>A revised edition of the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling classic: the epic story of the golden years of American space exploration, told by the men who rode the rockets.</b>As one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, Alan Shepard (1923&#x2013;1998) became the first American in space on May 5, 1961, and a decade later took, with his partner Edgar Mitchell, the longest walk&#x2014;two miles&#x2014;on the moon before hitting a golf ball for miles and miles across the lunar landscape.&nbsp;Another Mercury astronaut, Deke Slayton (1924&#x2013;1993) was meant to be the second American in Earth orbit, but was grounded because of an irregular heartbeat.&nbsp;He stayed on at NASA to supervise his fellow astronauts and was returned to flight status in 1972.&nbsp; In 1975, after sixteen years as head of the astronaut office, Slayton made it into space for the historic first docking of an American and a Russian spacecraft, a step that was a long stride on the road to end the Cold War.&nbsp;Jay Barbree (b. 1933) is the author of eight books and has been NBC&#x2019;s space correspondent since the birth of NASA.

In the process, they have remade the fabric of the world into newly functional objects that are also works of art to be admired. In this second edition of his popular <i>Existential Pleasures of Engineering</i>, Samuel Florman explores how engineers think and feel about their profession.</p><p>A deeply insightful and refreshingly unique text, this book corrects the myth that engineering is cold and passionless. Indeed, Florman celebrates engineering not only crucial and fundamental but also vital and alive; he views it as a response to some of our deepest impulses, an endeavor rich in spiritual and sensual rewards. Opposing the "anti-technology" stance, Florman gives readers a practical, creative, and even amusing philosophy of engineering that boasts of pride in his craft.</p></p><p>...clear, erudite, and occasionally eloquent, a useful read for engineers given to self-scrutiny and a stimulating one for the layman interested in the ancient schism between machines and men's souls. -- <i>Time Magazine</i><p><b>Samuel C.

Created with pastels, acrylics, and colored pencils, Avril&#x2019;s bold and wonderfully vivid mixed-media illustrations sometimes portray the classroom through Ginny&#x2019;s eyes, with overlapping images of chairs, books, and people, though they usually present an outside perspective. Based on Lyon&#x2019;s own experience, the sensitively written story radiates empathy and good humor. Even children who have not experienced Ginny&#x2019;s problem will understand her occasional frustration and find it intriguing that one person can literally see the world differently from another.

THE WORSHIP 0F BAAL: An Initial Look At Marcos Wealth &#x2013; Page 9 The first chapter sets the tone for the rest of the book by attempting to give an idea of the magnitude of the wealth Marcos and his cronies enjoyed. The spending behavior of the Marcos family is contrasted with the poverty of the rest of the country. It is argued that wealth and poverty are the cause and effect of each other. II. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRONY CAPITALISM - Page 66 The regime of Marcos and lmelda was not a temporary aberration from the historically established patterns of political and social behavior. The ostentation of Imelda and the corruption of Marcos merely represented in a most developed form the two anti&#x2014;social traditions of the country's social and political elite. Attempts are made to go beyond ordinary notions of corruption as a way of explaining cronyism as the defining trait of Marcos&#x2018; regime, It is suggested that the phenomenon of cronyism under Marcos be viewed as the use of state power for private interests. III. THE RELATIVES AND CRONIES &#x2013; Page 91 Every major economic activity was controlled by the First Family, their relatives, or cronies. These relatives and cronies acted as either as Marcos nominees or on their own behalf in key corporations and drew money from government, private, and international sources. The national coffer, the resources of private banks. international loans from multinational banks, and aid money from the US and Japan were placed at the disposal of Marcos' money-making network. Corporations owned or manned by cronies were provided extremely liberal government incentives, selectively granted tax exemptions, assigned lucrative government contracts, granted monopolies and captive markets through presidential decree. given easy and privileged access to credit from local and international financial institutions, and monopolized access to valuable market information available only to the government. When these methods did not suffice, military force was used as a factor in economic competition. This chapter presents case studies of selected cronies by outlining the activities of the following: Benedicto. Floirendo, Enrile, Cojuangco, Elizalde, Silverio, Cuenca, Velasco, Disini, Lucio Tan, Yao, Gapud. Roman Cruz, the Enriquez and Panlilio families, Bienvenido and Gliceria Tantoco, the Romualdez and the Marcos families. IV. THE OVERSEAS EMPIRE - Page 365 The Marcos family and their friends built an overseas empire which rivals the magnitude of the assets of the biggest multinational corporations. Sophisticated techniques of money laundering were used to hide and transport assets out of the country to amass fortunes in Swiss bank accounts, US real estate, as well as properties in other countries. While the previous chapter documented how wealth was extracted, this chapter discusses how the wealth was transferred overseas. - V. IN LIEU OF A CONCLUSION: Of Typewriters and Flags &#x2013; Page 460 Efforts by the Aquino government to recover Marcos&#x2019; wealth have had dismal results. The reasons for the failure in the recovery efforts are analyzed in this chapter.</p><p></p><h2>Narrowboating for Beginners: What Americans need to know when considering a narrowboat vacation in the UK</h2><p>Updated for 2018!

In <i>Being Catholic</i> Archbishop Pilarczyk teaches in clear, concise language the basic beliefs and practices of Catholics and what shapes a Catholic's thinking. The book discusses: <br><br> HOW WE BELIEVE: Believing Catholic is a matter of knowing, understanding and responding to a story-the true story of God's love for us. It offers "the fundamentals that have to be there if thinking and practicing Catholic are going to have any appeal or make any sense." <br><br> HOW WE PRACTICE: Reflections on the behaviors that express our faith and our membership in the Church, such as going to Mass, receiving the sacraments and raising children Catholic. By being a practicing Catholic, we strengthen our behaviors so we can proclaim them to others. <br><br> HOW WE THINK: A series of thoughtful, pastoral and heartfelt reflections on all aspects of our lives in the world, seen through the eyes of one deeply faithful to the tradition and teachings of the church. Topics for "Thinking Catholic" include respect for life, spiritual maturity and a universal Church.</p><p><b>DANIEL E.

Connoisseurs sat at tables between the hearths under glittering eighteenth-century chandeliers, chatting amiably in several languages. When the coffee arrived, a fine Colombian <i>supremo</i> steaming in its pots, the image of the corpse of a young man of uncommon beauty, lying on his back, materialized in the center of the room.</p><p>A gray winter light slanted into the hall, as the midday sun had sailed beyond the city, and the image on the large screen was crisp. The young man's blond locks were matted in a corona of dried blood, his sculpted cheekbones reduced to a pulp. The police photograph had been taken at night in a restaurant alley, and the surrounding scene was obscured in darkness. Yet the strobe light had thrown the young man's face into sharp relief. Out of the shadows of a distant southern night, the stark, wide-open eyes loomed over the room.</p><p>It was shortly before one o'clock in the afternoon, and the fifth and final course had been served to the connoisseurs of the Vidocq Society.</p><p>"My goodness," said a short-haired young woman in a red dress. Patting her mouth with a napkin, she excused herself from the table and, a hand over her mouth, hurried to the door. William Fleisher, a big man in a magnificent blue suit, <i>WLF</i> embroidered on his custom shirt, sadly shook his large, bearded head. "We need to do a better job screening guests," he said. Richard Walter, his gaunt cheekbones sunken in the wan light, glared at the departing figure. Frank Bender&#x2014;clad in a tight black T-shirt and jeans, the only man in the hall not wearing a suit&#x2014;whispered to the detective next to him, "Nice legs."</p><p>Fleisher shook his head in wonderment at the two eccentric, moody geniuses with whom he had thrown in his lot. His partners were criminologists without peer or precedent in his thirty years with the feds.</p><p>Forensic psychologist Richard Walter was the coolest eye on murder in the world. Tall and acerbic, he spoke with a clipped propriety that had earned him the moniker the Englishman from certain criminal elements. Walter had spent twenty years treating the most violent psychopaths in the state of Michigan at the largest walled penitentiary in the world, in Jackson, and at one of the toughest, the old Romanesque castle in Marquette on Lake Superior. His habit of peering over the top of his owlish black glasses and boring into the souls of inmates was known as the "Marquette stare," and it was a look to be avoided at all costs. He employed it to crack the fa�ade of psychopaths. Walter was unsurpassed in his understanding of the darkest regions of the heart. In his spare time, moonlighting as a consulting detective, he was one of the small group of American criminologists who invented modern criminal profiling in the 1970s and '80s to battle serial killers.</p><p>At Scotland Yard, which used him on the most extreme murder cases, he was known as the "Living Sherlock Holmes"&#x2014;an epithet that horrified him.</p><p>"Richard looks like Basil Rathbone in <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>," Fleisher said. "He talks like him, he thinks like him."</p><p>"Whenever someone says <i>that</i>," Walter said, "I look away and wait for the moment to pass, as if someone has just farted."</p><p>Frank Bender was the most celebrated forensic artist working at that time, perhaps in history. The wiry ex-boxer was muscled and balding, with a Van Dyke beard and piercing hazel eyes. For the occasion, he wore long sleeves that concealed his Navy tattoos. Bender, who grew up in tough North Philadelphia with bullets hitting the row house wall, was high school-educated, blunt-spoken, happily sex-addicted, and a psychic&#x2014;a gift he was shy about in the roomful of cops. But cops were awed by his ability to keep six or seven girlfriends happy as well as his wife, and to catch Most Wanted mass murderers with a sketchpad and scalpel. "Frank," Walter liked to tease him. "You would have been burned at the stake in the seventeenth century. Now you'll just get shot in the back."</p><p>The tall, melancholy, deductive Walter and the manic, intuitive Bender were blood brothers and partners on major cases. A detective duo without precedent, the psychologist and artist were capable of penetrating secrets of the living and the dead. When they could stand each other.</p><p>Bender saw dead people; Walter was contemptuous of spiritualism. The artist counted his sexual conquests in the hundreds; the psychologist, divorced, shrank from the touch of man, woman, child, dog, and cat. Walter was the most orderly mind on a murder, Bender the most chaotic.</p><p>William Lynn Fleisher was the glue that held the three together&#x2014;the one, friends said, "with a sail attached to the mast." The sartorial big man was the number two in charge of United States Customs law enforcement in three states, a world-class polygraph examiner and interrogator, a former FBI special agent, and an ex-Philadelphia beat cop. Fleisher was obsessed with the truth, had made himself a scholar of the history of truth-finding and an expert at distinguishing the truth from a lie. He used the polygraph to try to peer into the hearts of men to judge them, but really what he wanted to do was redeem them&#x2014;both the criminals whose psychophysiological signs spiked with guilt, and their tragic victims whose suffering society forgot. The big man, it was said by his special agents, had gained a hundred pounds to make room for his heart.</p><p>Bender and Walter were the most astonishing investigative team Fleisher had ever seen, equal parts reason and revelation, when they turned their combustible gifts on a killer and not on each other, like a man trying to extinguish his own shadow. The stout federal agent was the administrator who allowed them to take shape and function in the world.</p><p>They had met that morning in Bender's hall of bones, where a legendary and especially terrifying mob hit man had been the force that first brought them together, bonded in their fierce and awkward way, to create a private club of forensic avengers. Fleisher was sipping coffee with Bender at the kitchen table when the thin man entered the warehouse studio, nose wrinkled in disapproval "at the cat smells and whatever else."</p><p>"Richard!" Bender shouted, pumping Walter's hand enthusiastically, yet careful not to give a manly hug. "Let me show you my new painting!"</p><p>It was an enormous, brightly colored oil portrait of one of his many girlfriends, rendered in paint as thick as cake frosting. It was an eight-foot frontal nude; from the left nipple dangled a real brass ring.</p><p>"Chrissie has the cutest little butt," Bender said quietly, smiling as if visited by a wonderful memory.</p><p>Walter stood with his nose upturned, which pushed his mouth into a frown, studying the painting for a long moment.</p><p>"It's smut, Frank," he declared, turning away. "Simple smut." Bender howled with delight, as if there was no greater compliment. Walter glared at him. "Frank, Jesus Christ, you're almost sixty years old, and you're behaving like a fifteen-year-old Bolivian sex slave houseboy! You're using sex as an antidote to depression. As I have tried to explain, at our age it is not healthy for one to live as if one is poised before a mirror ringed with stage lights. One day the lights will go out and you will look in the mirror and see nothing at all.</p><p>"Now I'll take some coffee, black, if it's not too much trouble," Walter added. "I'm not fussy, so long as it wasn't boiled with a head."</p><p>Now with Fleisher in the great hall, Bender and Walter greeted each other warmly. The three men radiated an energy that seemed to animate the room. The habitual sadness in Fleisher's brown eyes lifted like a mist as he looked proudly across the gathering. All morning forensic specialists from around the globe had been quietly arriving at Second and Walnut streets in Philadelphia. They had gathered as they arrived in the high-ceilinged Coffee Room and Subscription Room on the first floor of the tavern, where colonists had once discussed politics, trade, and ship movements over the latest magazines and Franklin's <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>. Fleisher had felt the heady buzz of reunited friends, peers, and rivals. But now as he studied the assembly of sleuths from seventeen American states and eleven foreign countries, he sensed that something special was happening. Each man and woman was more renowned than the next.</p><p>There was FBI agent Robert Ressler, tall and silver-haired, who had confronted Charles Manson, John Wayne Gacy, and more "serial killers," a term he coined, than anyone in history. He was accepting congratulations, and no small amount of teasing, for <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, the new hit movie featuring Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter being hunted by the FBI's Jack Crawford, a character based partly on Ressler. Ressler was never far from his cohort Richard Walter. They were two of the greatest profilers in the world.</p><p>Of equal distinction were the forensic pathologists. Their table included Dr. Hal Fillinger of Philadelphia, who had proven that the "Unicorn Killer," fugitive Ira Einhorn, had murdered his girlfriend Holly Maddux; Fillinger had arrived in his big white Cadillac with the "Homicide Hal" vanity plates. Next to him sat Dr. Richard Froede of Arizona, who would autopsy the remains of kidnapped CIA agent William Buckley, tortured, murdered, and dumped at a Beirut roadside by Islamic jihadists. Among the Philadelphia cops was Frank Friel, the former homicide captain who solved the 1981 assassination of mob underboss Philip "Chicken Man" Testa, immortalized in Bruce Springsteen's song "Atlantic City": "...they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night..." Fleisher saw noted investigators of the JFK and Martin Luther King assassinations, and a CIA friend who was leading the bureau's secret war on Afghanistan, sitting with a colleague, a young blond female "spook" who loathed to show her face in public, even here. At the French table, with the agents from Interpol in Lyon, sat the director of <i>Brigade de la S�ret�</i> in Paris, the French equivalent of the FBI. <i>S�ret�</i>, founded in 1811 by Vidocq, had been the very first state investigative agency, later inspiring the creation of the FBI and Scotland Yard.</p><p>The chamber on the second floor of the City Tavern was the historic Long Room, forty-four feet long and narrow with a soaring chapel ceiling, the first ballroom in the New World, where General George Washington had toasted his election to the presidency as cannons boomed across the city and Madeira glasses smashed. By modern standards it was austere, a pale green chamber with chair rails and candle sconces. But now it had been arranged to re-create the spirit of a second-floor chamber in Paris in 1833. In the upstairs room of No. 12 <i>rue Cloche-Perce</i>, Vidocq had run the first private detective agency in history, <i>Le Bureau des Renseignements</i> (Office of Information), seventeen years before the Pinkerton Agency was founded in the United States. It was the first room in history designed for a group of men to systematically deduce and brainstorm solutions to murder cases.</p><p>In the north corner of the room, overlooking the Delaware River, a bronze bust of Eug�ne Fran�ois Vidocq rested on an oak pedestal. The wide, arrogant face was stippled in shadows from the heavy green drapes, beneath crossed French and American flags. In the room at No. 12 <i>rue Cloche-Perce</i>, in the flickering shadows of hissing gaslights, Vidocq and his men kept intricate records to track criminals' patterns. They discussed motive and modus operandi in greater detail than ever before in history. They made plaster casts of shoe impressions and studied bullets to link them to crimes. They worked under paintings of Damiens being quartered, John the Baptist losing his head, and Ravaillac being tortured. They were the first modern criminologists. Convinced of their superior knowledge of the criminal mind, Vidocq had chosen them from the ranks of ex-convicts, like himself.</p><p>Each of the men and women at the long tables wore a redwhite-blue pin on their lapels&#x2014;<i>Les Couleurs</i>, the colors of France, the signature of their status as Vidocq Society Members (VSMs). There were eighty-two VSMs, one for each year of Vidocq's life. It was the world's most exclusive club, open, regardless of race, sex, age, or national origin, only to the best detectives and forensic scientists on the planet. They had been called the greatest gathering of forensic detectives ever assembled in one room. "No police agency in the world has the luxury of this kind of talent," Fleisher said. <i>The New York Times</i> declared the Vidocq Society "The Heirs of Holmes." "This is not a gathering of a ragtag bunch of Baker Street Irregulars playing dutiful amanuensis to Sherlock Holmes's genius," the <i>Times</i> said. "Nor are they a bunch of good-natured Archie Goodwins, filling the role of narrator and legman to the sedentary but brilliant Nero Wolfe in the mystery novels of Rex Stout...It is a group that collectively has hundreds of years of crime-solving experience."</p><p>The Vidocq Society's mission was simple and straightforward: As many as one in three murders in the United States went unsolved. It was a well of suffering scarcely known to the journalists who claimed crime was sensational and overblown, or the millions of Americans entertained nightly by it on TV. Murder was a scourge that had taken more than a million lives, more than most of the American wars ever fought in the twentieth century. Cops were overworked, departments underfunded; the criminal justice system favored the rights of criminals over victims. In a world that had forgotten its heroes, they resolved, by the light of a twelfth-century chivalric pledge, to hunt down murderers in cold cases, punish the guilty, free the innocent, and avenge, protect, and succor families victimized by murder. They resolved to work pro bono rather than swat a golf ball around in Florida or Arizona. They met on the third Thursday of every month; they were the Thursday Club. The eighty-two of them pledged themselves to their cause until death, when the rosette would be pinned on another man or woman chosen to fight for a better world.</p><p>The old Victorian brownstone on Locust Street in Philadelphia, headquarters of the Vidocq Society, was besieged with requests from around the world from cops and victims seeking an audience in the private chamber in City Tavern. A congressman who wanted to solve a murder in his family. A federal agent in Washington who needed another pair of eyes on the assassination of a woman agent in broad daylight while jogging. A young, small-town Tennessee cop overmatched by an elderly millionaire serial killer who moved from state to state killing his wives. But the Vidocq Society would not touch a case unless it was a murder, the victim had committed no crimes, and the case was at least two years old, officially a "cold case." "Our mission is to help the police at their request, working quietly in the background without fanfare, to act as an agent for justice," Fleisher said. In all cases, the society required the presence in th...</p></p><h2>The Memory Jogger ISO 9001:2015</h2><p>The Memory Jogger&#x2122; ISO 9001:2015 is the best source for everyone in your organization to learn how to comply with the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 and maximize the value the framework of the standard can provide for your company.

The book makes its way through Spain, Cuba, Mexico, and Peru&#x2015;extraordinary cuisines Garces has come to know, love, and master. He shares not only recipes, but colorful memories of local cultures and insights into their unique ingredients and techniques. The cookbook features over 100 recipes tailored to the home cook, accompanied by over 100 food and travel photographs that truly immerse the reader. <br><br>Each chapter features a different country with menus highlighting Garces' takes on both mainstays of home cooking and popular street foods. The book is full of recipes for bright salads and ceviches, comforting stews, hearty beans, and tender braised meats. When a celebratory feast is in order, Jose's party menus are full of hors d'oeuvres, cocktails, and impressive fare for a kind of night where cooking becomes a part of the festivities. <br><br>Recipes are titled in both English and Spanish and stay true to their roots. Soulful, vibrant Latin dishes such as these will surely become the home-cooked staples of readers' kitchens: Green Plantain Empanadas with Braised Chicken, Grilled Spring Onions with Almond Sauce, Fried Stuffed Chiles, Braised Beef Stew with Red Beans, Pan-Roasted Shrimp with Tequila, and Salt-Baked Fish with Ginger Oil. From the gastronomic powerhouse that is Spain to the seafood-rich shores of fiery Peru, Garces showcases the heart of Latin cooking with dishes that are at once sophisticated and elemental.</p><p>Since opening his first restaurant, Amada, in 2005, Chef Jose Garces has emerged as one of the nation's most gifted young chefs, winning the James Beard Foundation's prestigious &#x201c;Best Chef Mid-Atlantic&#x201d; award in 2009. Garces authored his first cookbook in 2008: Latin Evolution (Lake Isle Press), strikingly photographed and focused on the future of Latin cuisine.

The book is also beautiful, with photography that stands out as a refreshing pop of color (and vegetables) in a season dominated by food photography in muted shades of brown. -- Paula Forbes, <i>Eater, October 2012</i><br><br>The cookbook serves as a Latin cooking primer, paying homage to the countries where Garces found his cooking soul: his ancestral home of Ecuador, as well as Spain, Cuba, Mexico, and Peru. Garces traveled extensively through those countries, absorbing then interpreting their cuisines for the restaurants he opened here. -- Maureen Fitzgerald, Food Editor, <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer, October 5, 2012</i></p><h2>CIVIL WAR TWO THE COMING BREAKUP OF AMERICA</h2><p>This book concerns an approaching civil war in America that will depopulate all of North America.</p><p></p><h2>The Indispensable Milton Friedman: Essays on Politics and Economics</h2><p><b>Milton Friedman</b> is one of the most famous economists in history.

He revolutionized our understanding of the Great Depression, helped establish the Chicago school of economics, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics. But eclipsing these achievements is the vital role he played at the crux of the long debate over capitalism in America. The 1970s was an all-time nadir for free market economics in the popular imagination. At the time it seemed that state management of the economy had finally triumphed. It was Friedman who almost single-handedly kept the argument for capitalism alive, stressing that the free market is the only way to achieve prosperity and retain personal liberty.<br><br><i>The Indispensable Milton Friedman</i> is the first general collection of Friedman&#x2019;s writings that spans his entire career, offering twenty scintillating essays selected from over five decades of writing, teaching, and research including some that have never been republished.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, she made history, becoming the first US gymnast to take home a team and an individual gold medal in the same Olympics. Gabrielle began her training at age six, and became the Virginia State Champion only two years later. When she was fourteen, she left her family in Virginia Beach to train with coach Liang Chow in Des Moines, Iowa. Under Chow&#x2019;s guidance, and with tremendous faith in God&#x2019;s plan for her, Gabrielle competed in the Olympic Trials and walked away with the only guaranteed spot on the team. Since her Olympic triumph, Gabrielle has used her platform to inspire millions with a powerful message: With hard work and persistence, any dream is possible.

Her single mother worked double shifts to make ends meet, and her siblings gave up their activities so Gabrielle could train. This inspiring autobiography will be enjoyed by young fitness enthusiasts, dedicated gymnasts, or Christian adolescents, though it focuses mostly on the family's sacrifice and less on the actual competition at the Olympics, which some listeners may find disappointing. While Haleakala Wilson speaks well with proper inflection and typical teen speak (sorta, kinda, lol) listeners may find it hard to discern how Gabrielle's mother feels. Is she angry or just frustrated when Gabrielle wants to quit? Listeners will understand that the family believes that their faith and determination to overcome obstacles is what led Gabrielle to be able to be the first African American to win the all-around competition.

And so do the attempts to understand God in the face of such evil.</strong> The problem of evil is a constant challenge to faith in God. How can we believe in a loving and powerful God given the existence of so much suffering in the world? Philosophers and theologians have addressed this problem countless times over the centuries. New explanations have been proposed in recent decades drawing on resources in Scripture, theology, philosophy, and science. <em>God and the Problem of Evil</em> stages a dialogue between the five key positions in the current debate: <ul><li>Phillip Cary: A Classic View</li><li>William Lane Craig: A Molinist View</li><li>William Hasker: An Open Theist View</li><li>Thomas Jay Oord: An Essential Kenosis View</li><li>Stephen Wykstra: A Skeptical Theism View</li></ul> According to the classic position, associated especially with the Augustinian tradition, God permits evil and suffering as part of the grand narrative of divine providence to bring about the redemption of creation. Molinism modifies the classic view by adding God's middle knowledge to the picture, in which God has knowledge of what creatures would do in all possible worlds. Open theism rejects the determinism of the classic view in favor of an account of God as a risk-taker who does not know for sure what the future holds. Essential kenosis goes further in providing a comprehensive theodicy by arguing that God cannot control creatures and thus cannot unilaterally prevent evil. Skeptical theism rejects the attempt to provide a theodicy and instead argues that, if God exists, we should not expect to understand God's purposes. Edited and with an introduction by Chad Meister and James K. Dew Jr., <em>God and the Problem of Evil</em> hosts a generous and informative conversation on one of the most pressing issues in the Christian life.</p><p>Chad Meister (PhD, Marquette University) is professor of philosophy at Bethel College in Mishawaka, Indiana. He is the author of numerous articles and books, including <em>The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity</em>, <em>Introducing Philosophy of Religion</em>, <em>Reasons for Faith: Making a Case for the Christian Faith</em> and <em>The Philosophy of Religion Reader</em>."It is always enlightening to listen to a conversation among scholars who care deeply about a topic, take strikingly different positions, and engage each other in considerate and substantive ways. That's just what <em>God and the Problem of Evil</em> provides: a stimulating conversation. Well-known proponents of five distinct approaches to the most vexing of philosophical and theological topics&#x2015;<em>Why is there suffering in God's world?</em>&#x2015;summarize their positions in clear, accessible ways. Then each shows just how his view compares to the others. The positions presented cover a broad spectrum, yet each addresses with urgency both the intellectual and personal challenges that evil presents. The book makes a valuable contribution to current considerations of the topic." (Richard Rice, Loma Linda University, author of Suffering and the Search for Meaning)<br><br>"How do we come to philosophical and theological grips with the vast amounts of evil in a world created by a perfectly good&#x2015;indeed, maximally great&#x2015;Being? <em>God and the Problem of Evil</em> helpfully lays out the various sides of the debate on this issue. Five philosophical theologians present the distinctive differences in their respective views, also noting the points on which they agree. The result is a volume that will serve as an excellent, up-to-date resource for those seeking to further explore this crucial&#x2015;and perennial&#x2015;question." (Paul Copan, professor and Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and Ethics, Palm Beach Atlantic University, author of A Little Book for New Philosophers)<br><br>"<em>God and the Problem of Evil</em> will be a helpful volume for those new to the discussion of this problem and looking for a brief overview of the possible arguments and counter-arguments made by Christian philosophers and theologians."

Knobbe has presented his hypothesis and supportive research on numerous stages all across the United States and for a number of organizations, including the Christian Ophthalmology Society, the Ancestral Health Symposium, the Weston A. Price Foundation, and the Macular Degeneration Association. Knobbe is the world's only ophthalmologist to have proffered such a hypothesis, but which has also been buttressed by supportive research, published in the highly esteemed journal, <em>Medical Hypotheses, </em>in November, 2017. <br> <br> Ophthalmologist and retina specialist of the United Kingdom, Andrew J. Luff, MA, FRCS, FRCS(Ophtha), FRCOphth, writes, "As the prevalence of AMD escalates, the devastating consequences of visual loss take their relentless toll on individuals, families, and health economies. This epidemic continues to grow, oblivious to a plethora of research. A massive financial investment (both University-based and pharmaceutical) has made no impact on the incidence of a disease that has resisted minor nutritional tinkering and seen no significant gain from our exponentially increased knowledge of genetics. In researching our frustrating lack of success in the quest for a unifying cause of AMD, Dr. Knobbe concludes that we have been looking in the wrong place.</p><p>"From a meticulous examination of ophthalmic history, comparative epidemiology and dietary change across the globe, he constructs a cogent and compelling argument for defects in basic nutrition as the fundamental driver of AMD. The data are stark and the potential consequences of dietary deficiency sobering. Dr. Knobbe's rational conclusion that a shift from traditional foods can wreak havoc on macular function will come as no surprise to those who have postulated similar cause for the multitude of chronic diseases now endemic in so-called developed nations.</p><p>"His hypothesis is unlikely to be welcomed by those committed to pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, a radical change to the diet of billions will not happen quickly. However, for newly diagnosed patients seeking hope and clinicians struggling for an answer, Dr. Knobbe's remarkable book offers the first tangible lifeline. To impact on the visual health of a nation we need a paradigm shift in the attitude of government and a radical rethink of the artificially constructed boundaries between nutrition and medicine. The visual health of many millions of people worldwide over the coming decades may depend on whether Knobbe's message is heard by those with both the political power and the financial commitment to take action."</p><p>-- Andrew J. Luff, MA, FRCS, FRCS(Ophtha, FRCOphth, Vitreo-Retinal Surgeon, United Kingdom, Fellow of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists<br> <br> Dr. Knobbe's revolutionary hypothesis, extraordinary research, and scientific rigor, is second to none. After having read the book or seen Knobbe's presentations, many have remarked, "How can his conclusions be refuted?" Come see how and why you can save your vision, by following a delicious, healthy, satisfying, diet, with virtually any food you desire, as long as it is made with "ancestral" ingredients. Shocking, but true!<br> <br> All proceeds from sales support the mission of Cure AMD Foundation. Dr. Knobbe receives no royalties from book sales. </p></p><p>Chris A. Knobbe, MD is an ophthalmologist and Associate Clinical Professor Emeritus, formerly of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, Texas. Dr. Knobbe, a native of Colorado, graduated from the University of Colorado School of Medicine in 1990, completed a transitional internship at Denver Presbyterian/St. Luke&#39;s Medical Centers, and then a three-year ophthalmology residency at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, in Denver. After seven years in private practice, Knobbe joined the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center as an Assistant Clinical Professor, a position he held until 2017. On a more personal note, at the age of 34, Dr. Knobbe began to suffer with arthritis, which progressed markedly over the next 16 years. At the age of 50 and after seeking the advice and treatment of nearly a dozen physician colleagues, Knobbe finally found dramatic relief - not by any traditional medicine or procedure - but rather, by altering his diet towards a more &#34;Paleo&#34; way of eating. This was a life-changing event for Knobbe, which sparked his interest in discovering as much as possible about the prophylactic and healing powers of food. The nutritional journey was a long and arduous one with peaks and valleys, until Knobbe discovered the research of Weston A. Price. Price completed an epic volume of nutritional anthropology and wrote a nutritional treatise in his book entitled, Nutrition and Physical Degeneration, which was published in 1939 followed by a second edition in 1945. Price detailed numerous discoveries in a nearly decade-long interval of on-the-ground research, in which he evaluated numerous populations on five continents as they transitioned from native, traditional diets, to Westernized diets, the latter of which were replete with man-made, processed, nutrient-deficient and toxic foods. Such diets led to numerous diseases of civilization and the previously healthy suffered numerous maladies. In 2013, Knobbe envisioned that Westernized food consumption might also be the primary driver of the disease age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness worldwide. This led to a revolutionary hypothesis, that is, that AMD might be a disease of processed food consumption, rather than a disease caused by aging and genetics as allopathic ophthalmology has believed for decades. In early 2015, with enough research to believe that the hypothesis would be supported by epidemiologic evidence, Knobbe left practice to pursue investigation of the hypothesis on a full-time basis. Some eighteen months later, the fundamental research with AMD prevalence correlated to processed food consumption in 25 nations was complete. More importantly, the evidence strongly supported the hypothesis. On August 12, 2016, Dr. Knobbe made the debut presentation of his revolutionary hypothesis for the cause of AMD at the Ancestral Health Symposium, held at the University of Colorado Boulder. He&#39;s made dozens of presentations in cities all across the U.S. since then, published a scientific paper in the journal Medical Hypotheses, and has founded Cure AMD Foundation(TM), the latter being a nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status in support of this cause. Dr. Knobbe&#39;s hypothesis, scientific paper and book, while accepted by numerous physicians and ophthalmologists, has not resulted in broad supportive dietary advice by mainstream allopathic ophthalmology. However, ancestral nutrition researchers and progressive physicians now understand that the exact same advice (ancestral diets) is preventing all the diseases of civilization, including heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancers, type 2 diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disorders, and so much more. Thus, Dr. Knobbe continues his work -- at saving vision. Come join those who are saving their own vision, in this revolution!<p>"In our opinion, Dr. Knobbe has uncovered an important connection between diet and age-related macular degeneration that has the potential to prevent hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people from progressing to the advanced stages of this disease.</p><p> -- Editorial Board, Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation, Price-Pottenger Journal of Health and Healing, Summer - 2017</p><p><strong>____________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p>"I have found Dr Knobbe's theory well researched and presented in his book. Although no one can accurately say exactly what the incidence of AMD was in the early 1900's, he presents a compelling argument, based in fact, that not only is AMD on the rise and reaching epidemic proportions, but it's coincident with the introduction of processed, nutrient deficient, foods. Perhaps most compelling is, after reading his book, I now find myself taking extra chair time to discuss dietary issues with my patients. I would say this is a must read for any eyecare provider, but particularly those practicing primary eyecare with the goal of preventing AMD." </p><p>-- Micah W. Rothstein, MD Ophthalmologist, Eye Care Center of Northern Colorado<br> <br> ______________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>"Dr. Knobbe's thesis that macular degeneration is due to dietary causes is well-supported by his research. Drawing on the observations of Dr. Weston A. Price, who studied traditional cultures living on unrefined and unprocessed foods, the author makes his point quite clearly: Our present-day diet is a major culprit in the proliferation of not only AMD, but most likely for many other degenerative diseases of civilization as well. Here is where so many current studies are woefully behind; the answers are right in front of us if we dare to look. Dr. Knobbe has done just that, and he deserves great credit for bringing this topic to the public with this very readable book."</p><p>-- Ed Bennett, President, Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br> <br> "Dr. Knobbe, I heard your lecture at the Christian Ophthalmology Society meeting. I want to congratulate you on your research into your discovery/hypothesis as I found it to be profound and surprising. It has potential to alleviate more preventable blindness than any multi-billion dollar anti-VEGF [wet AMD drugs] industry. I just wanted to encourage your efforts and hopefully this isn't something that's looked back on in a century as a missed opportunity."<br> <br> -- Jonathan P.

For example, in the winter of 1965, as a high school dropout, he stood alone in his mother's kitchen wondering what had happened to his dream. He had thought he would be a professional drummer by then, basking in the roar of applause and well on his way to a brilliant career. Instead, he could hear only echoes of the shotgun blast that nearly took his life the night before. He imagined a pointless future of street fights and felonies in which the best he could hope for was a low-level position in the Chicago Mafia. Knowing there was no way out, he was close to despair. Then the phone rang; the rest is music history. </p><p>And in this book, for the first time, Seraphine tells the painful story, from the heart, of close friend and cofounder Terry Kath's death and of Seraphine's traumatic 1990 firing from the band and the pain that he has only recently overcome.</p><p>Complete with dozens of photos from Chicago's early years, Street Player is an uncommonly powerful rock memoir that is easy to pick up and very hard to put down.</p><p>Chicago has thrilled music fans for more than forty years with their musical and lyrical brilliance.

All the while his political adversaries in Rome grow ever more powerful. So that when the fighting is over, Julius will face the greatest threat to him yet&#x2014;a man who wants Rome for himself.</p><p>Conn Iggulden is the author of three novels about Genghis Khan, as well as the Emperor novels, all of which are available in hardcover and in paperback from Dell. He is also the coauthor of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller<i> The Dangerous Book for Boys</i>. He lives with his wife and children in Hertfordshire, England.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>Julius stood by the open window, gazing out over Spanish hills. The setting sun splashed gold along a distant crest so that it seemed to hang in the air unsupported, a vein of light in the distance. Behind him, the murmur of conversation rose and fell without interrupting his thoughts. He could smell honeysuckle on the breeze and the touch of it in his nostrils made his own rank sweat even more pungent as the delicate fragrance shifted in the air and was gone.<br><br>It had been a long day. When he pressed a hand against his eyes, he could feel a surge of exhaustion rise in him like dark water. The voices in the campaign room mingled with the creak of chairs and the rustle of maps. How many hundreds of evenings had he spent on the upper floor of the fort with those men? The routine had become a comfort for them all at the end of a day, and even when there was nothing to discuss, they still gathered in the campaign rooms to drink and talk. It kept Rome alive in their minds and at times they could almost forget that they had not seen their home for more than four years.<br><br>At first, Julius had embraced the problems of the regions and hardly thought of Rome for months at a time. The days had flown as he rose and slept with the sun and the Tenth made towns in the wilderness. On the coast, Valentia had been transformed with lime and wood and paint until it was almost a new city veneered over the old. They had laid roads to chain the land and bridges that opened the wild hills to settlers. Julius had worked with a frenetic, twitching energy in those first years, using exhaustion like a drug to force away his memories. Then he would sleep and Cornelia would come to him. Those were the nights when he would leave his sweat-soaked bed and ride out to the watch posts, appearing out of the darkness unannounced until the Tenth were as nervous and tired as he was himself.<br><br>As if to mock his indifference, his engineers had found gold in two new seams, richer than any they had known before. The yellow metal had its own allure, and when Julius had seen the first haul spilled out of a cloth onto his desk, he had looked at it with hatred for what it represented. He had come to Spain with nothing, but the ground gave up its secrets and with the wealth came the tug of the old city and the life he had almost forgotten.<br><br>He sighed at the thought. Spain was such a treasure-house it would be difficult to leave her, but part of him knew he could not lose himself there for much longer. Life was too precious to be wasted, and too short.<br><br>The room was warm with the press of bodies. The maps of the new mines were stretched out on low tables, held by weights. Julius could hear Renius arguing with Brutus and the low cadence of Domitius chuckling. Only the giant Ciro was silent. Yet even those who spoke were marking time until Julius joined them. They were good men. Each one of them had stood with him against enemies and through grief, and there were times when Julius could imagine how it might have been to cross the world with them. They were men to walk a finer path than to be forgotten in Spain, and Julius could not bear the sympathy he saw in their eyes. He knew he deserved only contempt for having brought them to that place and buried himself in petty work.<br><br>If Cornelia had lived, he would have taken her with him to Spain. It would have been a new start, far away from the intrigues of the city. He bowed his head as the evening breeze touched his face. It was an old pain and there were whole days when he did not think of her. Then the guilt would surface and the dreams would be terrible, as if in punishment for the lapse.<br><br>"Julius? The guard is at the door for you," Brutus said, touching him on the shoulder. Julius nodded and turned back to the men in the room, his eyes seeking out the stranger amongst them.<br><br>The legionary looked nervous as he glanced around at the map-laden tables and the jugs of wine, clearly awed by the people within.<br><br>"Well?" Julius said.<br><br>The soldier swallowed as he met the dark eyes of his general. There was no kindness in that hard, fleshless face, and the young legionary stammered slightly.<br><br>"A young Spanish at the gate, General. He says he's the one we're looking for."<br><br>The conversations in the room died away and the guard wished he were anywhere else but under the scrutiny of those men.<br><br>"Have you checked him for weapons?" Julius said.<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"Then bring him to me. I want to speak to the man who has caused me so much trouble."<br><br>Julius stood waiting at the top of the stairs as the Spaniard was brought up. His clothes were too small for his gangling limbs, and the face was caught in the change between man and boy, though there was no softness in the bony jaw. As their eyes met, the Spaniard hesitated, stumbling.<br><br>"What's your name, boy?" Julius said as they came level.<br><br>"Adan," the Spaniard forced out.<br><br>"You killed my officer?" Julius said, with a sneer.<br><br>The young man froze, then nodded, his expression wavering between fear and determination. He could see the faces turned toward him in the room, and his courage seemed to desert him then at the thought of stepping into their midst. He might have held back if the guard hadn't shoved him across the threshold.<br><br>"Wait below," Julius told the legionary, suddenly irritated.<br><br>Adan refused to bow his head in the face of the hostile glares of the Romans, though he could not remember being more frightened in his life. As Julius closed the door behind him, he started silently, cursing his nervousness. Adan watched as the general sat down facing him, and a dull terror overwhelmed him. Should he keep his hands by his sides? All of a sudden, they seemed awkward and he considered folding them or clasping his fingers behind his back. The silence was painful as he waited and still they had their eyes on him. Adan swallowed with difficulty, determined not to show his fear.<br><br>"You knew enough to tell me your name. Can you understand me?" Julius asked.<br><br>Adan worked spit into his dry mouth. "I can," he said. At least his voice hadn't quavered like a boy's. He squared his shoulders slightly and glanced at the others, almost recoiling from the naked animosity from one of them, a bear of a man with one arm who seemed to be practically growling with anger.<br><br>"You told the guards you were the one we were looking for, the one who killed the soldier," Julius said.<br><br>Adan's gaze snapped back to him. "I did it. I killed him," he replied, the words coming in a rush.<br><br>"You tortured him," Julius added.<br><br>Adan swallowed again. He had imagined this scene as he walked over the dark fields to the fort, but he couldn't summon the defiance he had pictured. He felt as if he were confessing to his father, and it was all he could do not to shuffle his feet in shame, despite his intentions.<br><br>"He was trying to rape my mother. I took him into the woods. She tried to stop me, but I would not listen to her," Adan said stiffly, trying to remember the words he had practiced.<br><br>Someone in the room muttered an oath, but Adan could not tear his eyes away from the general. He felt an obscure relief that he had told them. Now they would kill him and his parents would be released.<br><br>Thinking of his mother was a mistake. Tears sprang from nowhere to rim his eyes and he blinked them back furiously. She would want him to be strong in front of these men.<br><br>Julius watched him. The young Spaniard was visibly trembling, and with reason. He had only to give the order and Adan would be taken out into the yard and executed in front of the assembled ranks. It would be the end of it, but a memory stayed his hand.<br><br>"Why have you given yourself up, Adan?"<br><br>"My family have been taken in for questioning, General. They are innocent. I am the one you want."<br><br>"You think your death will save them?"<br><br>Adan hesitated. How could he explain that only that thin hope had made him come?<br><br>"They have done nothing wrong."<br><br>Julius raised a hand to scratch his eyebrow, then rested his elbow on the arm of the chair as he thought.<br><br>"When I was younger than you, Adan, I stood in front of a Roman named Cornelius Sulla. He had murdered my uncle and broken everything I valued in the world. He told me I would go free if I put aside my wife and shamed her with her father. He cherished such little acts of spite."<br><br>For a moment, Julius looked into the unimaginable distance of the past, and Adan felt sweat break out on his forehead. Why was the man talking to him? He had already confessed; there was nothing else. Despite his fear, he felt interest kindle. The Romans seemed to bear only one face in Spain. To hear they had rivalry and enemies within their own ranks was a revelation.<br><br>"I hated that man, Adan," Julius continued. "If I had been given a weapon, I would have used it on him even though it meant my own life. I wonder if you understand that sort of hatred."<br><br>"You did not give up your wife?" Adan asked.<br><br>Julius blinked at the sudden question, then smiled bitterly. "No. I refused and he let me live. The floor at his feet was spattered with the blood of people he had killed and tortured, yet he let me live. I have often wondered why."<br><br>"He did not think you were a threat," Adan said, surprised by his own courage to speak so to the general. Julius shook his head in memory.<br><br>"I doubt it. I told him I would devote my life to killing him if he set me free." For a moment, he almost said aloud how his friend had poisoned the Dictator, but that part of the story could never be told, not even to the men in that room.<br><br>Julius shrugged. "He died by someone else's hand, in the end. It is one of the regrets of my life that I could not do it myself and watch the life fade from his eyes."<br><br>Adan had to look away from the fire he saw in the Roman. He believed him, and the thought of this man ordering his own death with such malice made him shudder.<br><br>Julius did not speak again for a long time, and Adan felt weak with the tension, his head jerking upwards as the general broke the silence at last.<br><br>"There are murders in the cells here and in Valentia. One of them will be hanged for your crimes as well as his own. You, I am going to pardon. I will sign my name to it and you will go back to your home with your family and never come to my attention again."<br><br>Renius snorted in amazement. "I would like a private word, General," he grated, looking venomously at Adan. The young Spaniard stood with his mouth open.<br><br>"You may not have one, Renius. I have spoken and it will stand," Julius replied without looking at him. He watched the boy for a moment and felt a weight lift off him. He had made the right decision, he was sure. He had seen himself in the Spaniard's eyes and it was like lifting a veil into his memory. How frightening Sulla had seemed then. To Adan, Julius would have been another of that cruel type, wrapped in metal armor and harder thoughts. How close he had come to sending Adan to be impaled, or burnt, or nailed to the gates of the fort, as Sulla had with so many of his enemies. It was an irony that Sulla's old whim had saved Adan, but Julius had caught himself before he gave the order for death and wondered at what he was becoming. He would not be those men he had hated. Age would not force him into their mold, if he had the strength. He rose from his seat and faced Adan.<br><br>"I do not expect you to waste this chance, Adan. You will not have another from me."<br><br>Adan almost burst into tears, emotions roiling and overwhelming him. He had prepared himself for death, and having it snatched away and freedom promised was too much for him. On an impulse, he took a step forward and went down on one knee before anyone could react.<br><br>Julius stood slowly, looking down at the young man before him.<br><br>"We are not the enemy, Adan. Remember that. I will have a scribe prepare the pardon. Wait below for me," he said.<br><br>Adan rose and looked into the Roman's dark eyes for a last moment before leaving the room. As the door closed behind him, he sagged against the wall, wiping sweat from his face. He felt dizzy with relief and every breath he pulled in was clear and cold. He could not understand why he had been spared.<br><br>The guard in the room below craned his head to stare up at Adan's slumped figure in the shadows.<br><br>"Shall I heat the knives for you, then?" the Roman sneered up at him.<br><br>"Not today," Adan replied, enjoying the look of confusion that passed over the man's face.<br>Brutus pressed a cup of wine into Julius's hand, pouring expertly from an amphora.<br><br>"Are you going to tell us why you let him go?" he said.<br><br>Julius lifted the cup to cut off the flow and drank from it before holding it out again. "Because he was brave," he said.<br><br>Renius rubbed the bristles of his chin with his hand. "He will be famous in the towns, you realize. He will be the man who faced us and lived. They'll probably make him mayor when old Del Subi&#x2014; dies. The young ones will flock around him and before you know it--"<br><br>"Enough," Julius interrupted, his face flushing from the heady wine. "The sword is not the answer to everything, no matter how you may wish it so. We have to live with them without sending our men out in pairs and watching every alley and track for ambush." His hands cut shapes in the air as he strained to find words for the thought.<br><br>"They must be as Roman as we are, willing to die for our causes and against our enemies. Pompey showed the way with the legions he raised here. I spoke the truth when I said we were not the enemy. Can you understand that?"</p><h2>The Compleat Angler: Classics in Fishing Series</h2><p>The Compleat Angler, Izaak Walton&#x2019;s fishing classic, is a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing.

My father's voice roared up the stairwell and startled me out of my trance. "You better get a move on or you'll miss the bus!" he said as I was enthralled in the mishaps of a blue jay on my windowsill. The same blue jay that had visited me on a regular basis for the past two years.<br><br>"I'm coming, Daddy!" I got up off my bed and threw a stack of journals into my duffel bag. I had already managed to cram most of my meager wardrobe into the trunk my mother gave me -- a hand-me-down that once belonged to my great-grandmother. My duffel bag held the most important items though: all of my favorite photographs, my collection of show ribbons I won over the years in junior horseback riding competitions, and my journals.<br><br>There was no way I would leave my journals behind for my younger siblings or, God forbid, my parents to find. My life had not been all that exciting up to now -- in fact, I wished I had more scandal to write about. Still, the pages contained my private thoughts and my personal history. They were for my eyes only.<br><br>"Mary Ann, don't make me have to come up there and get you!" Daddy yelled again. He was obviously more nervous than I was about my leaving home for law school in Washington, D.C. He had been worked up for more than a month, trying to make sure I had everything that I needed for the trip. Granted, moving from South Dakota clear across the country was a major undertaking for me. I had never been outside my home state. I did my undergraduate work at a local college so I could stay close to my parents and help them out with the chicken farm and in the raising of my rambunctious sisters and brothers. I am the eldest of nine. I felt guilty about leaving them all behind but attending Hartsdale Law School had always been a dream of mine. I had worked hard to get accepted, basically giving up my social life to make sure I had good enough grades. I lucked out. I was offered a scholarship so I was flat out of excuses not to leave.<br><br>The night before my departure, my twelve-year-old sister Caroline came into my room and pleaded with me not to go. It was one of the hardest conversations of my entire life and ended with both of us in tears. By the time she returned to the bedroom she shared with Liza and Amelia, I think I had managed to convince her that I was doing the right thing. Nonetheless, I was dreading going downstairs to say goodbye. I just knew it would be emotional and depressing.<br><br>"Mary Ann!" I could really hear the irritation in my daddy's voice. "Get a move on! Now!"<br><br>I grabbed my duffel bag off the bed, looked around my cozy bedroom one last time, and tried to let it all sink in. I took a mental photograph of the teddy bear collection on my window seat, the flowery pink wallpaper, and my thirteen-inch television that had seen much better days and was missing an antenna for more than three years. I knew that my parents would reassign my bedroom to some of my siblings, so it would be drastically different by the time I returned home for a visit. The scenario would not be one where I would come back ten years later with my husband and children and everything would be exactly as I left it. That only happens in movies.<br><br>As I made my way down the steep set of stairs, I tried to fight back the tears. I was twenty-two years old and had no business acting childish about the situation. This move was my decision and I had to live with it. I reached the bottom of the steps, expecting to see several sets of pouted lips and soggy eyes. Instead, I had the shock of my life. A chorus of cheers began.<br><br>"Mary Ann! Mary Ann! She's our woman! If she can't do it, no one can!" All of my family members had raised their voices for me and I was overwhelmed. They had painted posters and draped colorful streamers all over the living room and dining room area. Each of my siblings took turns giving me cards they had made for me and presents.<br><br>By the time I walked out onto the porch ten minutes later, my duffel bag was filled to the brim with everything from a spinning top and black baby doll to a small collection of baseball cards and the sack of country-ham biscuits my mother made me for the bus.<br><br>I hugged all of my siblings in the house. Only my mother followed me onto the porch while Daddy went around back to get his pickup truck from the detached garage.<br><br>I turned to face my mother but had trouble making eye contact. "I'm going to miss you, Momma," I stated in a barely audible voice. "I'm going to miss everybody so much." Somehow I had managed to stay dry-eyed through the well-wishing inside, but not now.<br><br>My mother lifted my chin, forcing me to look into her eyes. "We love you, Mary Ann. Your father and I are extremely proud of you."<br><br>"I know that, Momma." I gave her a huge bear hug and whispered in her ear, "I'll continue to make you proud of me. I promise."<br><br>She pulled back from me slightly and gathered my head in both of her hands. I noticed the age lines on her face for the very first time. But she was still beautiful with her perfect mocha complexion, deep-set brown eyes, and high cheekbones.<br><br>"Mary Ann, I know that you'll do your best at law school and that's all we can ask from you."<br><br>"But the kids, Momma," I protested. "How will you and Daddy manage without me?"<br><br>She started giggling. "We'll miss you dearly but, trust me, we can handle that group of rowdy chaps in there."<br><br>I laughed along with her. "Yeah, but you have to admit they can be a handful."<br><br>"No more so than you were." She kissed me lightly on the cheek. "In fact, you were two handfuls."<br><br>I glanced at my watch and realized I had less than an hour before the bus left. It would take at least forty minutes for Daddy to make it into town. He drove at a snail's pace.<br><br>"I have to go, Momma." I gave her another hug and clenched my eyes shut. The tears were flowing whether I wanted them to or not. "I'll call you as soon as I get settled in the dorm."<br><br>"Bye, baby!"<br><br>I ran down the porch steps just as my father was pulling around the house. I leapt into the passenger side, slammed the door, and covered my face with my hands. I didn't want my mother to see more crying.<br><br>Daddy pulled off with a jerk and didn't say a word to me until we got on the highway a good fifteen minutes later. I had managed to calm down some, but my breathing was still shallow. He placed his hand on my knee. "Mary Ann, it's going to be okay." As I looked over at him, he had a cinematic smile on his face. "I hear Washington, D.C., is a great city to live in. Full of opportunities for lawyers."<br><br>"I'm not a lawyer yet, Daddy," I managed to utter. "I haven't even officially started law school yet."<br><br>"True, but in three years you'll be a lawyer. A damn good one at that."<br>I grinned at him. He always managed to brighten the darkest of days. "I'm glad you have so much confidence in me."<br><br>"Hell, you're a Ferguson and what a Ferguson wants, a Ferguson gets!"<br><br>"Daddy, if that were true, then I would be able to stay in South Dakota and attend Hartsdale Law."<br><br>"Well, a Ferguson gets <i>almost</i> anything they want." He chuckled. Both of our moods turned solemn and we fell silent once again for a few seconds. "Hey, have you heard the one about the bald chicken and the blue pig?"<br><br>"Oh boy, not another joke!" I wasn't really in the right frame of mind for his silly chicken jokes but I humored him. "Go ahead and tell it, Daddy!"<br><br>He had me laughing all the way to the bus depot, babbling on and on about chickens. Beyond his family, chickens are my father's entire life. In fact, chicken farming has been the occupation of my family for generations. My great-grandparents lived in the same farmhouse where I grew up. I was going to miss home something terrible: the ten-foot-high ceilings, the fireplace in the dining room, the view of the sunset from the loft of the barn.<br><br>We arrived at the bus station ten minutes before bus 1013 was due to depart. My daddy rushed to get my trunk off the bed of the truck and underneath the bus before they slammed the cargo section shut. Afterward, we stood on pins and needles, neither one of us wanting to say goodbye.<br><br>"I don't have to go, Daddy," I blurted out.<br><br>"Yes you do," he quickly replied. "This is what you've always wanted. You've worked hard for this and, gosh darnit, you're going to go as far as that brain of yours will take you."<br><br>"What if I'm not good enough for them?"<br><br>"You're good enough for everybody. You're just not <i>for</i> everybody. Don't let anyone tell you any different." He threw his arm around my shoulder and pulled me close. "Now get on that bus and call us when you get to D.C."<br><br>I grasped onto his waist for dear life. "Thanks for bringing me into this world, Daddy. Thanks for everything."<br><br>"No, thank you." He brushed his lips across my forehead and then pushed me away from him toward the steps of the bus. "Get on now."<br><br>I was halfway up the steps when I turned to look at him one more time, all six feet five inches of him. I toppled back down the steps, threw my arms around his neck, and gave him a big wet one on his left cheek. "Bye, Daddy!"<br><br>"Bye, sweetheart!"<br><br>I got settled on the bus and waved at him as he got back in his truck and abruptly pulled off. I guess watching the bus depart would have been too much for him. My daddy hates to show emotion. He thinks it is a sign of male weakness. I think showing how you feel is a sign of sincerity, but he is one of those old-fashioned men who could never comprehend such a notion.<br><br>No sooner had the bus pulled away than I spotted Clarence running around the corner by the feed store flailing his arms and screaming my name. "Mary Ann! Mary Ann!"<br><br>I placed my palm up against the cool glass of the window and then waved at him. He looked frustrated, depressed, and disappointed. I guess he thought he might have changed my mind the last time we were together.<br><br>Clarence was my high school sweetheart and the only lover I had ever had. While I didn't think he was an exceptional lover, I didn't have anyone to compare to him. I probably wasn't exceptional myself. After all, I was very timid when it came to sex. Good girls don't engage in lewd sexual acts. That's how I was raised. That was the bottom line.<br><br>Clarence and I had gathered up enough nerve to watch some porno films on a couple of occasions. They seemed to make him uncomfortable. But I, on the other hand, was enthralled by sexy movies. I couldn't believe women actually performed certain sex acts without passing out or gagging on the huge dicks of the men in those flicks.<br><br>Saying goodbye to Clarence was difficult. I wished I could have taken him with me to D.C. but it just wasn't fathomable. He was in training to take over his father's carpentry business and there was no way he could leave town. We were together for the last time three nights before. We spent time together in the small, cramped apartment he rented above the local convenience store on Main Street. He begged me to stay and I begged him to stop begging me for something I couldn't give him. We fell asleep drenched in each other's tears and sweat from making love.<br><br>Seeing him standing there on the corner -- finer than frog's hair with his curly black hair, bronze complexion, and sparkling hazel eyes -- made me want to tell the bus driver as we pulled away to stop and let me off. I couldn't though. I had to do what I had to do. In time, I would get over Clarence. I didn't have a choice.<br><br>I settled back into my seat and spoke to the elderly white woman who had claimed the aisle seat beside me. She seemed friendly enough. She was headed to Alexandria, Virginia, to see her four grandchildren. She almost talked my ear off, bragging about them and flashing their wallet-sized photos at me. I fell asleep a few hours later, even though it was only mid-morning. I had a long trip and an even longer law school experience ahead of me. I hoped I could handle it.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Zane</p><h2>BattleTech: Betrayal of Ideals</h2><p><b>THE TRUE FATE OF CLAN WOLVERINE...<b></b>Every member of modern Clan society knows of the Not-Named Clan, the one that was erased from history for perpetrating acts of heresy against the Way of the Clans.

The Pentagon Civil War is long over, and Operation Klondike saw ilKhan Nicholas Kerensky&#x2019;s twenty Clans victorious over the petty warlords who had conquered the Pentagon worlds. But with no true enemies left to fight, the nascent Clans have lost their laser-sharp focus, and begun straying from the ilKhan&#x2019;s vision.Khan Sarah McEvedy, leader of the progressive Clan Wolverine, sees the dangerous path the ilKhan is steering his Clans onto, but she cannot follow them without compromising her beliefs or her honor. Unsure whom to trust among the scheming Clans, she must navigate the political waters of the Grand Council with caution and resolve, or suffer the deadly consequences. As her enemies seek to engineer her Clan into the ultimate scapegoat, Khan McEvedy must do everything she can to ensure her Clan survives, or they will all be hunted down and destroyed.Written by <i>BattleTech</i> veteran Blaine Lee Pardoe, <i>Betrayal of Ideals</i> tells the complete story of the true history of Clan Wolverine.</b></p><p></p><h2>Strength Training: The Complete Step-by-Step Guide to a Stronger, Sculpted Body</h2><p>Providing exercises for all parts of the body and taking you step-by-step through each movement, highlighting exactly which muscle should be working when, <i>Strength Training</i> is the ultimate personal trainer.

The mold avoidance approach described in this book was developed with the goal of helping these extremely ill and stubbornly treatment-resistant individuals (often described as having myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic Lyme, fibromyalgia, multiple chemical sensitivity, Gulf War illness, POTS or toxic mold illness). The underlying premise of the approach presented here is that many or all of these individuals suffer from a severe hyperreactivity to certain kinds of mold toxins. This approach suggests that insofar as individuals are reacting to very low levels of these mold toxins, decreasing exposures to a level that does not prompt a reaction will allow movement toward wellness to be achieved. Both of the authors of this book were very sick with this kind of illness for many years and have become mostly recovered as a result of this approach. During recent years, many other individuals who were very ill with this sort of disease also have experienced major improvements as a result of following this approach. This book is designed to share the basics of the approach with a broader audience, so that more sufferers can learn about it and decide if it might be worth pursuing.</p><p></p><h2>Georgia Peaches and Other Forbidden Fruit</h2><p><p><strong><em>"A sweet, sexy, honest teen romance that just happens to involve two girls&#x2014;all the more charming for being so very ordinary.&#x201d;*</em> </strong></p><p><strong>A <em>Kirkus</em> Best Book of the Year!

Teaching with Story contains 20 of these useful stories that can be used by teachers with their students.<br></p><p><br></p>PreSchool-Grade 3AAn experienced storyteller has set an old cautionary tale from Thailand in modern dress. Aree's parents shower their daughter with brilliant silk dresses and lovely jewels. A dance held in a nearby village offers Aree a chance to display her sumptuous wardrobe. Determined to be the most beautiful girl there, she cannot decide upon one dress or one jewel, so she ends up wearing all of them. She is so weighed down with layers of finery that she cannot keep up with her friends as they walk over the hill to the dance. When they suggest that she remove some garments, she accuses them of jealousy. In a version collected in Thailand by Kermit Krueger and retold in his collection The Serpent Prince (World, 1969; o.p.), the vain, foolish girl dies of exhaustion. MacDonald's version allows her to learn her lesson and live to practice voluntary simplicity. The story is told in rhythmic, cadenced sentences, ideal for reading aloud. The illustrations substitute modern rural Thailand for the archaic setting of the original tale and depict the characters as somewhat stylized figures dressed in brightly colored Thai silks. An author's note acknowledges Krueger's retelling, puts the tale in cultural context, and suggests strategies for telling it. The text is printed in Thai at the bottom of each page. Art and narrative create an appealing blend of ancient and contemporary wisdom.AMargaret A.

Yet beneath the seeming differences lies a pool of universal truth. <i>Oneness</i> collects these beliefs together in one volume, in the actual words of each religion&#x2019;s scriptures. These universal principles&#x2014;The Golden Rule . . . Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother . . . Heaven Is Within . . . As We Sow, We Shall Reap . . . Judge Not . . . God Is Love, and others&#x2014;guide us to inner peace, and allow us to achieve spiritual richness. <i>Oneness</i> is a gift of love.</p><p>Author's note: The most recent edition of <i>Oneness</i>, published in 2002 in softcover and 2007 in the Kindle edition, contains more than twice as many principles and sayings as previous editions. Also, the recent edition is fully annotated, providing the source of each scriptural saying in the book. Many readers and reviewers have been asking for this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Library Review article on this page, which mentions the lack of annotations, pertains to one of the earliest editions of <i>Oneness</i>, published in 1989-90.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the reviews of <i>Oneness</i> above, you'll notice a comment made by Mother Teresa about the book. In a private conversation between us, she said: "I pray that this book accomplishes what God wants it to." While this may sound a bit vague, what she meant by this, she explained, is that God has a special purpose for every action. People's individual desires and egos, however, often distort this. Her prayer meant that she hoped people would not thwart or alter God's intention for the message of <i>Oneness</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> This book was written simply, not to argue that all religions are the same, but to show that the great scriptural principles we all associate with spirituality are expressed very similarly--and in some cases almost word-for-word--in all religions. The book was designed so a simple glance at any of the pages would give the message that the underlying similarities of the world's religions are unifying. They have the overwhelming effect of creating "Oneness," in which differences dissolve and the soul can wonder, Why do we have such conflicts?&#x201c;As this book shows . . . every major religion of the world has similar ideas of love [and] the same goal of benefiting humanity through spiritual practice.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The Dalai Lama<br><br>&#x201c;An impressive array of selections.

In 1000 B.C. King David led Israel into a radical reformation and spiritual revolution when he built a throne of unceasing worship and prayer right in the governmental center of the nation. Since then thousands of groups have set out to pioneer expressions of 24-7 worship and prayer. From the underground church of Northern Iraq, to the entertainment capitol of Hollywood, CA the church is crying out night and day! What is God up to? Why this emphasis on worship and prayer?

I have been fascinated by it for more than 40 years. What is it? It is given as the explanation &nbsp;of the Gospel crossing the racial and cultural barrier out of a Jewish sect into a transformational missionary movement to the Nations of the Earth in Acts 15. But, what is it? No one I know has articulated this as well and as deeply as David Fritch. He gets it! He has lived it.

In 1911 he became Professor of Greek and New Testament Exegesis at Mansfield College, Oxford, and subsequently served at the United Free Church College, Glasgow, and at Union Theological Seminary, New York, as Washburn Professor of Church History. Moffatt took a leading role in the preparation of the Revised Standard Version (1946) as well as writing numerous books on biblical textual criticism. Moffatt is best remembered, however, for single-handedly translating the Bible. His New Testament was printed in 1913, followed by the Old Testament in 1924. Both translations were revised and reprinted together in 1935 and popularly known as Moffatt&#39;s Bible.</p><h2>The Gospel of John Participant Guide: Finding Identity and Purpose (DVD Small Group)</h2><p><p><em>Jesus has called you.

Instead, they spend their lives essentially disconnected from others, rushing through life content with brief visits and casual conversations. But what if one were to develop a community, a spiritual community, of people who walked with and supported each other through life's journey? A community of real friends who listened to each other's personal tragedies without merely trying to fix the problems, who encouraged and nurtured each other's strengths, and who accepted people for who they really are, instead of the image they try to portray. In <em>Becoming a True Spiritual Community&nbsp;</em>(formerly titled <em>The Safest Place on Earth</em>),&nbsp;Larry Crabb explores such a place, where God can heal disconnected people and allow them to reconnect with each other and, ultimately, with Him.</p><p>Dr. Larry Crabb is a well-known psychologist, conference and seminary speaker, Bible teacher, popular author, and founder/director of NewWay Ministries.

The book brings Tony&#x2019;s memories to life with beautiful reproductions of some of Mir�&#x2019;s finest works, as well as evocative archival photography by Lee Miller and specially commissioned artworks in the style of Mir�, painted by children. We see the renowned painter from a new perspective, as the slightly eccentric visitor to Tony&#x2019;s childhood home, during an excursion to Mir�&#x2019;s farm&#x2015;filled with extraordinary creatures&#x2015;and on a trip to London Zoo, during which Mir� asked to see &#x201c;large birds, snakes, and strange creatures of the night.&#x201d; Vibrant design and playful typography make the package as appealing as the story, and round out the feeling that we&#x2019;re immersed in Tony&#x2019;s adventure. Illustrated in color throughout</p><p>Antony Penrose is the son of Lee Miller and Roland Penrose and is director of the Lee Miller Archives and The Penrose Collection. His other books&nbsp;include The Lives of Lee Miller,&nbsp;Lee Miller&#x2019;s War, and the acclaimed children&#x2019;s book,&nbsp;The Boy Who Bit Picasso.&nbsp;He lives in Sussex.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;A charming narrative about the surrealist painter Joan Mir�, from the perspective of the author as a young boy. (The author is the son of Roland Penrose and Lee Miller, artists and friends of Mir�.) Penrose recalls Mir�'s visits to the Penrose farm in Sussex, England, and the delight with which Mir� quietly observed the world around him. The narrative oscillates between relating Mir�'s paintings to everyday farm objects and animals and recalling his life in Spain and visits to the zoo in London. The text questions readers about what they see in the paintings but also implores them to find "imagination and magic" in everything they look at. Photographs, many taken by Miller; reproductions of Mir�'s work; and specially commissioned drawings by real children complement and support one another and the writing. Readers gain an understanding of what the artist looked like, how he worked, and the animals he looked at to make his work. Throughout the book, a peppering of children's illustrations, drawn in a Mir�-like way, support the idea of embracing the unusual and wondrous. VERDICT This title makes Mir�'s work feel as though it were created just to delight the imagination of children; a general purchase for collections looking to expand their artist biographies selections.&#x2014;Jessica Cline, New York Public Library</p><h2>Dark Stranger Immortal (The Children Of The Gods Paranormal Romance)</h2><p><b>"I have absolutely loved each book in this series. </b>The book was well thought out.

What if at the source of those myths were events and personalities that left an impact so profound that their echoes could be heard in the mythologies of civilizations continents and millennia apart?&nbsp;Could they perhaps originate from realistic hallucinations induced by members of an advanced species who exhibit some of the characteristics of those mythical creatures?&nbsp;More than seven thousand years ago, the first advanced human civilization appeared out of nowhere. Archeological records show that the Sumerians knew about the solar system and placed the sun at its center, had schools for children, girls and boys, established laws to protect personal property, and afforded women the kind of rights they hadn't enjoyed since Sumer's decline and up until modern times.&nbsp;The Sumerians accredited their gods with providing the blueprints for their civilization and their advanced scientific knowledge, as well as the creation of humankind itself - a hybrid the gods engineered by combining the genetic material of a god with that of a lesser creature.The abbreviated version of their creation myth isn't the only one to find its way into the bible, albeit modified to fit its monotheistic agenda. Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden are there as well. Though in the Sumerian version, the snake is a sympathetic god who decides to grant humans knowledge of a carnal nature (which is the way the term knowledge, or to know is used throughout the bible), giving humans the ability to procreate, which as hybrids they previously lacked.&nbsp;Another god, the head of the Sumerian pantheon, considers humans' rapid procreation a threat to the gods (implying that the gods were not as fruitful) and throws them out of the gods' garden.<br><br><b>THE CHILDREN OF THE GODS ORIGINS </b><ul><li>1: Goddess's Choice</li></ul><ul><li>2: Goddess's Hope</li></ul><br><b>THE CHILDREN OF THE GODS</b><br><br><b>Dark Stranger</b> <ul><li>1: Dark Stranger The Dream </li></ul><ul><li>2: Dark Stranger Revealed</li></ul><ul><li>3: Dark Stranger Immortal</li></ul><b>Dark Enemy</b> <ul><li>4: Dark Enemy Taken</li></ul><ul><li>5: Dark Enemy Captive </li></ul><ul><li>6: Dark Enemy Redeemed</li></ul><b>Kri &amp; Michael's Story</b> <ul><li>6.5: My Dark Amazon </li></ul><b>Dark Warrior</b> <ul><li>7: Dark Warrior Mine</li></ul><ul><li>8: Dark Warrior's Promise</li></ul><ul><li>9: Dark Warrior's Destiny</li></ul><ul><li>10: Dark Warrior's Legacy </li></ul><b>Dark Guardian</b><ul><li>11: Dark Guardian Found</li></ul><ul><li>12: Dark Guardian Craved </li></ul><ul><li>13: Dark Guardian's Mate</li></ul><b>Dark Angel</b><ul><li>14: Dark Angel's Obsession </li></ul><ul><li>15: Dark Angel's Seduction</li></ul><ul><li>16: Dark Angel's Surrender </li></ul><b>Dark Operative</b><ul><li>17: Dark Operative: A Shadow of Death</li></ul><ul><li>18: Dark Operative: A Glimmer of Hope</li></ul><ul><li>19: Dark Operative: The Dawn of Love</li></ul><b>Dark Survivor</b><ul><li>20: Dark Survivor Awakened </li></ul><ul><li>21: Dark Survivor Echoes of Love</li></ul><ul><li>22: Dark Survivor Reunited</li></ul><b>Dark Widow</b><ul><li>23: Dark Widow's Secret</li></ul><ul><li>24: Dark Widow's Curse </li></ul><ul><li>25: Dark Widow's Blessing </li></ul><b>Dark Dream</b><ul><li>26: Dark Dream's Temptation </li></ul><ul><li>27: Dark Dream's Unraveling </li></ul><ul><li>28: Dark Dream's Trap</li></ul><b>Dark Prince</b><ul><li>29: Dark Prince's Enigma</li></ul><ul><li>30: Dark Prince's Dilemma</li></ul><ul><li>31: Dark Prince's Agenda</li></ul><b>THE PERFECT MATCH SERIES</b><ul><li>Perfect Match 1: Vampire's Consort</li></ul> <ul><li>Perfect Match 2: King's Chosen</li></ul><ul><li>Perfect Match 3: Captain's Conquest</li></ul>No Bio<br><br>No Bio</p><h2>A Beginner&#x2019;s Guide to the End: How to Live Life to the Full and Die a Good Death</h2><p><p>"<b>I wish I'd had this book when I needed it. </b>Death and dying are not subjects that many people are comfortable talking about, but it's hugely important to be as prepared as you can be - emotionally, physically, practically, financially, and spiritually. <b>This book may be the most important guide you could have.</b>" - Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <b><i>Eat Pray Love</i></b></p><p> <b>___________</b></p><p>The end of a life can often feel like a traumatic, chaotic and inhuman experience.

This is &#x201c;emphatically a book for anyone who cares about the security of this country&#x201d; (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>).</p><p>John Rizzo had a thirty-four-year career as a lawyer at the&nbsp;CIA, culminating with seven years as the Agency&#x2019;s chief legal officer.&nbsp;In the post-9/11 era, he helped create and implement the full spectrum of aggressive counterterrorist operations against Al Qaeda, including the so-called &#x201c;enhanced interrogation program&#x201d; and lethal strikes against the Al Qaeda leadership.&nbsp;He has served as senior counsel at a Washington DC law firm and is a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution. He is a graduate of Brown University and George Washington University Law School.Company Man INTRODUCTION<p></p> The Tale of the &#x201c;Torture&#x201d; Tapes<p></p> <br>In early November 2010, the Justice Department announced its decision not to bring obstruction-of-justice charges against the CIA officials who had been involved in the decision, five years earlier, to destroy videotapes depicting the Agency&#x2019;s 2002 interrogation of an Al Qaeda operative named Abu Zubaydah. He was not just any terrorist thug. Zubaydah was a senior figure in the Al Qaeda hierarchy at the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and he had been the CIA&#x2019;s first significant &#x201c;catch&#x201d; in the post-9/11 era. As such, he was also the first high-level Osama bin Laden lieutenant to be spirited off to one of the Agency&#x2019;s newly constructed covert detention facilities&#x2014;what would come to be infamously known around the world as &#x201c;the CIA&#x2019;s secret prisons.&#x201d; Zubaydah had another dubious distinction: He was the first CIA detainee ever to be waterboarded. The CIA had captured it all on videotape. Three years later, the Agency burned the tapes.<br> <br>The Justice Department criminal investigation into the tapes&#x2019; destruction, which lasted almost three years, was led by John Durham, a career federal prosecutor from Connecticut brought in specifically for the task. He was appointed in December 2007, shortly after the New York Times broke the story in a series of page 1 articles by Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane. The series ignited an immediate firestorm in the media and Congress. As the Times accurately reported, no one in the CIA had ever told anyone in Congress that it had destroyed the tapes.<br> <br>It was a hell of a story about a hell of a mess. And I knew it better than anyone, since I was the only member of the CIA&#x2019;s top leadership to have been part of the episode from the beginning to just about its end. I was the Agency&#x2019;s chief legal advisor for most of the eight years encompassing the story. The tale of the tapes&#x2019; destruction and its aftermath bedeviled me right up to the time of my retirement from the CIA in December 2009, after more than thirty years of service. The saga ended for me only when Justice announced there would be no indictments.<br> <br>For the first three years, I fended off repeated entreaties from my Agency colleagues that I approve destroying the tapes, only to have them go behind my back and destroy them anyway in 2005. Then, after the story exploded in the media, I was the only CIA official to be hauled before Congress and grilled&#x2014;alone&#x2014;by two dozen angry lawmakers. Two years later, in September 2009, I had to testify for seven hours before a grand jury convened by the prosecutor, Durham.<br> <br>The case was still hanging over me when I left the Agency for good two months later. In a long career fraught with dealing with controversies, it was the final one, and it was unfinished business. And so I could not drift gently, at long last, into a peaceful retirement. Would I be called back to testify before Congress? Before the grand jury? Would I be prosecuted for something I said, or something I did, somewhere along the way?<br> <br>The November 2010 Justice Department announcement that there would be no indictments brought me a mixed range of emotions. First, of course, I felt a huge sense of belated relief. At the same time, it seemed oddly anticlimactic&#x2014;by November 2010, the tapes&#x2019; destruction was old news, a distant if unpleasant memory.<br> <br>Finally, it all struck me as very ironic. The entire affair, long and tortuous as it turned out to be, had begun for me way back at a time when I thought I was getting out of the line of fire at the CIA.<br> <br><br> <br>In October 2002, my nearly one-year tour of duty as acting general counsel was coming to a close. The Senate had just confirmed Scott Muller as the new CIA general counsel.<br> <br>By this time, twenty-five years into my CIA career, I had &#x201c;broken in&#x201d; a number of incoming general counsels, so I had the drill down pat: The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) staff prepared briefing books containing summaries of key classified policy and legal documents as well as ongoing programs (per standard procedure, no incoming GC had access to classified information before reporting for duty), and I put together a list of the &#x201c;hot&#x201d; items that the new guy would have to confront the day he arrived on the job.<br> <br>I felt a profound sense of relief about passing the Agency&#x2019;s legal baton. Barely a year after 9/11, I could have put fifty items on the &#x201c;hot&#x201d; list. It seemed like every day we were facing a new, imminent Al Qaeda threat. And we had been operating in an entirely new and perilous legal terrain, capturing, brutally interrogating, and conducting lethal operations against senior Al Qaeda figures. I didn&#x2019;t want Scott totally overwhelmed on his first day of work, so I was determined to keep the list short.<br> <br>A couple of weeks before he arrived in November 2002, however, I learned about something I had no choice but to add to the list. Three months earlier, CIA officers, in a secret Agency detention facility overseas, began videotaping the first top Al Qaeda operative in our custody. He was also the first terrorist subjected to the Agency&#x2019;s Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EITs). The sessions were captured on the tapes, apparently in graphic detail. Jose Rodriguez, the chief of our Counterterrorist Center (CTC), came to me seeking permission to destroy the tapes. Immediately.<br> <br><br> <br>The story began in March 2002, when the CIA and its Pakistani counterparts, with a combination of meticulous intelligence work and good luck, captured a senior Al Qaeda operative named Abu Zubaydah in Pakistan&#x2019;s third-largest city, Faisalabad. It didn&#x2019;t come off quietly&#x2014;there was a furious gun battle, and Zubaydah was shot three times. The Agency rushed a team of doctors from Johns Hopkins to Pakistan to save his life. It was hardly a humanitarian gesture; our intelligence indicated that Zubaydah was Al Qaeda&#x2019;s main logistics planner for attacks against the United States. The CIA was desperate to keep him alive in order to find out what he knew about any upcoming attacks. This was barely six months after 9/11, and the government was still seized with dread about another horrific strike coming any day.<br> <br>Zubaydah pulled through, and as soon as the doctors determined he was well enough to travel, he was whisked from Pakistan to the first of a succession of overseas detention facilities that would eventually enter into the public lexicon as &#x201c;black sites&#x201d; or &#x201c;secret prisons.&#x201d; Zubaydah, a young, smart, cold-blooded, unrepentant psychopath, was the first really &#x201c;big fish&#x201d; the Agency had caught post-9/11. Soon after the questioning began, CIA inquisitors became convinced, based on his smug and arrogant responses, that he knew a lot more than he was telling about Al Qaeda&#x2019;s terrorist plans. By early April 2002, the Agency, lacking other options and desperate to stop another cataclysmic attack, made the fateful decision to explore tougher methods to try to get Zubaydah to talk. This was how the &#x201c;enhanced interrogation program&#x201d; came to be, along with yet another word soon to enter the public lexicon: waterboarding.<br> <br>Later in the book I will provide an eyewitness narrative of the period from April through July 2002, when the Agency conceived the EIT program, which I shepherded through policy review at the White House and legal review at the Justice Department. This process culminated on August 1, when the Justice Department issued to me the first of what would come to be known infamously as the &#x201c;torture memos,&#x201d; which legally approved waterboarding and other brutal interrogation tactics against Zubaydah. After I received the Justice memo, the waterboarding of Zubaydah began, with my knowledge and concurrence.<br> <br>What I didn&#x2019;t know then and wouldn&#x2019;t know until two months later was the decision&#x2014;I could never determine whether someone at CIA Headquarters or in the field with Zubaydah came up with the idea&#x2014;to videotape Zubaydah around the clock while he was in custody, including periods of interrogation. When he first told me about the videotaping in October 2002, Jose offered two reasons. First, our people at the interrogation site wanted to make sure everything Zubaydah said was recorded and preserved. They were taking careful and copious contemporaneous notes, which were duly transcribed in cables sent back to CIA Headquarters every day, but they were terrified they might miss something. It&#x2019;s important to note here that, prior to 9/11, the CIA had never in my quarter-century experience held and questioned anyone incommunicado. In a popular culture steeped with films, TV shows, and potboiler spy novels portraying the CIA as a no-holds-barred instrument of mayhem, this may be hard for an outsider to believe. But it&#x2019;s true. The videotaping was seen not just as a reference tool but as a security blanket.<br> <br>The other reason Jose gave me for the decision to videotape Zubaydah was more basic: His people didn&#x2019;t want the SOB to die on them. CIA medical personnel at the detention facility monitored Zubaydah round the clock, but he was about to face some very tough interrogation in the most solitary of confinements. If Zubaydah were to die in captivity, who would believe&#x2014;either inside or outside the CIA&#x2014;that they weren&#x2019;t to blame? Videotaping Zubaydah in captivity would cover their asses.<br> <br>After several days of taping, however, everyone who had bought into the idea looked at the videotapes, compared them with the notes transcribed and forwarded to headquarters, and concluded that the notes captured everything Zubaydah was saying. In fact, the notes were better; Zubaydah&#x2019;s voice was occasionally inaudible on the recordings, but the interrogators had been able to get down most everything he was saying. Besides that, Zubaydah had recovered from his wounds and was exhibiting no desire to journey to the afterlife&#x2014;even with the seventy-two virgins presumably awaiting his arrival&#x2014;anytime soon. The hundred or so hours of videotapes were packed up and stored at the detention facility.<br> <br>But Jose&#x2019;s sudden desire that October to destroy the tapes was not spurred by an urgent need to eliminate unnecessary clutter. It was based on what the tapes showed.<br> <br>The round-the-clock videotaping had lasted only a few days in August 2002 before it was stopped, and the bulk of it recorded Zubaydah alone in his cell, either saying prayers, sleeping, reading, or otherwise&#x2014;um&#x2014;entertaining himself. The rest of the tapes showed the interrogation sessions, and Jose assured me that the scenes of Zubaydah being waterboarded, comprising only a small portion of the tapes, were uncensored, and everything had followed the guidelines formulated by CIA Headquarters and approved by the Justice Department in its August 1 top-secret memorandum to me (the so-called torture memo). That was his good news. His bad news was that the scenes were &#x201c;tough to watch&#x201d; and, more to the point, clearly showed the faces of the CIA employees and contractors on the scene.<br> <br>Jose was convinced that someday, somewhere, somehow, the tapes would become public and the identities of the interrogators inevitably &#x201c;outed.&#x201d; &#x201c;Sixty Minutes will do slow-mo, stop-action pictures of their faces,&#x201d; Jose emotionally put it to me, &#x201c;and they and their families will become targets for some Al Qaeda crazy wherever they are.&#x201d;<br> <br>I had known Jose for over a decade, and I had no reason to doubt his sincerity or his word. A short, dark man in his late forties whose voice carried the lilt of his upbringing in Puerto Rico, Jose (who had a law degree) could be fiery and over the top rhetorically at times, but I always found him to be honest, straightforward, and utterly without guile&#x2014;traits I suspect the public would not normally ascribe to a longtime CIA operative. He was an honorable, decent guy, and I considered him a friend. I still do.<br> <br>I also didn&#x2019;t think at the time that Jose and his colleagues were being paranoid in fearing that the tapes would someday be made public. If all my years and experience at the CIA taught me anything, it&#x2019;s that virtually every secret doesn&#x2019;t stay secret forever, and that the shelf life of new secrets is getting shorter all the time. As I write this today, consider all that happened in the eight years since I first learned about the tapes: the steady stream of media leaks about &#x201c;secret prisons&#x201d; and &#x201c;waterboarding&#x201d;; the ensuing drumbeat of outrage from elements of Congress, pundits, and the academic community as the shock and horror of 9/11 receded into history; and finally, a new president and his attorney general who publicly repudiated and voluntarily declassified virtually every detail of the CIA&#x2019;s interrogation program. If those tapes were still in existence, what do you suppose are the chances they would now be in the public domain? Somewhere between probably and slam-dunk.<br> <br>But that is now, and this was then. Although I sympathized with Jose&#x2019;s motivations, I thought destroying the tapes was fraught with enormous risk for the Agency. Any minimally competent attorney would instinctively react the same way if his client were to come to him seeking the go-ahead to destroy sensitive materials in his possession, even if the client was not under any cloud of suspicion or investigation. Someone does something like that when he has something to hide.<br> <br>And the tapes, obviously, were not ordinary material. Given who Zubaydah was, and given why it was considered so critical to get him to talk, a Congress and a nation still shell-shocked by 9/11 might have understood and even supported such tactics. Indeed, only a month earlier, in September 2002, the bipartisan leadership of Congress (the so-called Gang of 8) had been briefed by the CIA on the newly approved techniques, including waterboarding, and expressed no concern whatsoever. But to have this disturbing stuff captured on videotape, and then to destroy it without telling anyone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean, Jesus. I trusted Jose and believed his assurances that everything on the tapes was within the approved guidelines, but once they were gone, and once someone on the outside inevitably found out about the tapes and what had happened to them, who was going to accept those assurances at face value?<br> <br>So that was the big turd dumped on my desk shortly before the arrival of the new general counsel. &#x201c;Who else in senior management knows about the tapes and what you want to do with them?&#x201d; I asked Jose. &#x201c;What about Pavitt?,&#x201d; referring to his superior, Jim Pavitt, the head of CIA covert operations.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pavitt knows, and he&#x2019;s ready to authorize the destruction, but he said I needed to get your okay,&#x201d; Jose responded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is George Tenet on this?&#x201d; I then asked as calmly as I could, referring to the CIA director.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I haven&#x2019;t spoken to him about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I informed Jose that he was not to do anything with those tapes. Not then, and not until further notice. I needed to talk about this with the new general counsel.<br> <br>Poor Scott Muller, I thought. Here he was coming in from private life, with a totally blank slate, and now I had to firehose him not only on a counterterrorist program of an unprecedented scope and nature, but also, by the way, on an urgent request to destroy hair-raising evidence about the program. I was hoping he wouldn&#x2019;t quickly conclude he was joining an organization, and inheriting a deputy, who were completely crazy.<br> <br><br> <br>Thankfully, Scott proved to be a quick study and not easily rattled. He agreed that precipitously destroying the tapes was a terrible idea.

Kinsella plays with both myth and fantasy in his lyrical novel, which was adapted into the enormously popular movie, <i>Field of Dreams.</i> It begins with the magic of a godlike voice in a cornfield, and ends with the magic of a son playing catch with the ghost of his father. In Kinsella's hands, it's all about as simple, and complex, as the object of baseball itself: coming home.

But if it is going to happen for us, we need to take time. We need to slow down and do something out of the ordinary, something that has to do with the spiritual meaning of the feast and the season.&nbsp;Reading the Christmas poems of&nbsp;<i>Seeing Haloes</i>&nbsp;is one way of doing this. John Shea hopes that each poem strikes a chord and brings us into memories we may have forgotten and present experiences we may have overlooked. When this happens, the Spirit arrives to illumine our minds, inspire our wills, and gladden our hearts.

The English chocolatiers introduced the world's first chocolate bar and ever fancier chocolate temptations&#x2014;while also writing groundbreaking papers on poverty, publishing authoritative studies of the Bible, and campaigning against human rights abuses. Chocolate was always a global business, and in the global competitors, especially the Swiss and the Americans Hershey and Mars, the Quaker capitalists met their match. The ensuing chocolate wars would culminate in a multi-billion-dollar showdown pitting Quaker tradition against the cutthroat tactics of a corporate behemoth.<br><br> Featuring a cast of savvy entrepreneurs, brilliant eccentrics, and resourceful visionaries, <i>Chocolate Wars</i> is a delicious history of the fierce, 150-year business rivalry for one of the world's most coveted markets.<br></p><p><b>Deborah Cadbury</b> is a writer, award-winning documentary producer for the BBC, the author of seven books, and a relative of the famous Quaker family that gave their name to one of the world's most famous brands of chocolate.<i><b>Business Times</b></i><br> &#x201c;Fascinating...<i>Chocolate Wars</i> presents narrative history at its most absorbing, peopled by colourful characters: the true story of the chocolate pioneers, the visions and ideals that inspired them and the mouth-watering concoctions they created...

Only one man can warn the planet Florinia that it is doomed by an astronomical catastrophe -- but he has amnesia and is a slave.</b></p><p>High above planet Florinia, the Squires of Sark live in unimaginable wealth and comfort. Down in the eternal spring of the planet, however, the native Florinians labor ceaselessly to produce the precious kyrt that brings prosperity to their Sarkite masters.</p><p>Rebellion is unthinkable and impossible. Not only do the Florinians no longer have a concept of freedom, any disruption of the vital kyrt trade would cause other planets to rise in protest, resulting in a galactic war. So the Trantorian Empire, whose grand plan is to unite all humanity in peace, prosperity, and freedom, has allowed the oppression to continue.</p><p>Living among the workers of Florinia, Rik is a man without a memory or a past. He has been abducted and brainwashed. Barely able to speak or care for himself when he was found, Rik is widely regarded as a simpleton by the worker community where he lives. As his memories begin to return, however, Rik finds himself driven by a cryptic message he is determined to deliver: Everyone on Florinia is doomed...the Currents of Space are bringing destruction. But if the planet is evacuated, the power of Sark will end-so there are those who would kill the messenger. The fate of the Galaxy hangs in the balance.</p></p><p><p><b>Isaac Asimov</b>, author of the Foundation trilogy and many other novels, was one of the great SF writers of the twentieth century.</p><p><strong>Chapter One </strong></p><p><strong><strong>The Foundling </strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Rik put down his feeder and jumped to his feet. He was trembling so hard he had to lean against the bare milk- white wall. </strong></p><p><strong>He shouted, &#x201c;I remember!&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>They looked at him and the gritty mumble of men at lunch died somewhat. Eyes met his out of faces indifferently clean and indifferently shaven, glistening and white in the imperfect wall illumination. The eyes reflected no great interest, merely the reflex attention enforced by any sudden and unexpected cry. </strong></p><p><strong>Rik cried again, &#x201c;I remember my job. I had a job!&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>Someone called, &#x201c;Shoddop!&#x201d;and someone else yelled, &#x201c;Siddown!&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>The faces turned away, the mumble rose again. Rik stared blankly along the table. He heard the remark, &#x201c;Crazy Rik,&#x201c;and a shrug of shoulders. He saw a finger spiral at a man&#x2019;s temple. It all meant nothing to him. None of it reached his mind. </strong></p><p><strong>Slowly he sat down. Again he clutched his feeder, a spoon-like affair, with sharp edges and little tines projecting from the front curve of the bowl, which could therefore with equal clumsiness cut, scoop and impale. It was enough for a mill-worker. He turned it over and stared without seeing at his number on the back of the handle. He didn&#x2019;t have to see it. He knew it by heart. All the others had registration numbers, just as he had, but the others had names also. He didn&#x2019;t. They called him Rik because it meant something like &#x201c;moron&#x201d;in the slang of the kyrt mills. And often enough they called him &#x201c;Crazy Rik.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>But perhaps he would be remembering more and more now. This was the first time since he had come to the mill that he had remembered anything at all from before the beginning. If he thought hard! If he thought with all his mind! </strong></p><p><strong>All at once he wasn&#x2019;t hungry; he wasn&#x2019;t the least hungry. With a sudden gesture, he thrust his feeder into the jellied briquet of meat and vegetables before him, pushed the food away, and buried his eyes in the heels of his palms. His fingers thrust and clutched at his hair and painstakingly he tried to follow his mind into the pitch from which it had extracted a single item&#x2014;one muddy, undecipherable item. </strong></p><p><strong>Then he burst into tears, just as the clanging bell announced the end of his lunch shift. </strong></p><p><strong>Valona March fell in beside him when he left the mill that evening. He was scarcely conscious of her at first, at least as an individual. It was only that he heard his footsteps matched. He stopped and looked at her. Her hair was something between blonde and brown. She wore it in two thick plaits that she clamped together with little magnetized green- stoned pins. They were very cheap pins and had a faded look about them. She wore the simple cotton dress which was all that was needed in that mild climate, just as Rik himself needed only an open, sleeveless shirt and cotton slacks. </strong></p><p><strong>She said, &#x201c;I heard something went wrong lunchtime.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>She spoke in the sharp, peasant accents one would expect. Rik&#x2019;s own language was full of flat vowels and had a nasal touch. They laughed at him because of it and imitated his way of speaking, but Valona would tell him that that was only their own ignorance. </strong></p><p><strong>Rik mumbled, &#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s wrong, Lona.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>She persisted. &#x201c;I heard you said you remembered something. Is that right, Rik?&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>She called him Rik too. There wasn&#x2019;t anything else to call him. He couldn&#x2019;t remember his real name. He had tried desperately enough. Valona had tried with him. One day she had obtained a torn city directory somehow and had read all the first names to him. None had seemed more familiar than any other. </strong></p><p><strong>He looked her full in the face and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to quit the mill.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>Valona frowned. Her round, broad face with its flat, high cheekbones was troubled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you can. It wouldn&#x2019;t be right.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to find out more about myself.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>Valona licked her lips. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you should.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>Rik turned away. He knew her concern to be sincere. She had obtained the mill job for him in the first place. He had had no experience with mill machinery. Or perhaps he had, but just didn&#x2019;t remember. In any case, Lona had insisted that he was too small for manual labor and they had agreed to give him technical training without charge. Before that, in the nightmarish days when he could scarcely make sounds and when he didn&#x2019;t know what food was for, she had watched him and fed him. She had kept him alive. </strong></p><p><strong>He said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Is it the headaches again, Rik?&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;No. I really remember something. I remember what my job was before&#x2014;&#x2014;Before!&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>He wasn&#x2019;t sure he wanted to tell her. He looked away. The warm, pleasant sun was at least two hours above the horizon. The monotonous rows of workers&#x2019; cubicles that stretched out and round the mills were tiresome to look at, but Rik knew that as soon as they topped the rise the field would lie before them in all the beauty of crimson and gold. </strong></p><p><strong>He liked to look at the fields. From the very first the sight had soothed and pleased him. Even before he knew that the colors were crimson and gold, before he knew that there were such things as colors, before he could express his plea sure in anything more than a soft gurgle, the headaches would flicker away faster in the fields. In those days Valona would borrow a diamagnetic scooter and take him out of the village every idle-day. They would skim along, a foot above the road, gliding on the cushioned smoothness of the counter- gravity field, until they were miles and miles away from any human habitation and there would be left only the wind against his face, fragrant with the kyrt blossoms. </strong></p><p><strong>They would sit beside the road then, surrounded by color and scent, and between them share a food briquet, while the sun glowed down upon them until it was time to return again. </strong></p><p><strong>Rik was stirred by the memory. He said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go to the fields, Lona.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s late.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Please. Just outside town.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>She fumbled at the thin money pouch she kept between herself and the soft blue leather belt she wore, the only luxury of dress she allowed herself. </strong></p><p><strong>Rik caught her arm. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s walk.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>They left the highway for the winding, dustless, packed- sand roads half an hour later. There was a heavy silence between them and Valona felt a familiar fear clutching at her. She had no words to express her feelings for him, so she had never tried. </strong></p><p><strong>What if he should leave her? He was a little fellow, no taller than herself and weighing somewhat less, in fact. He was still like a helpless child in many ways. But before they had turned his mind off he must have been an educated man. A very important educated man. </strong></p><p><strong>Valona had never had any education besides reading and writing and enough trade- school technology to be able to handle mill machinery, but she knew enough to know that all people were not so limited. There was the Townman, of course, whose great knowledge was so helpful to all of them. Occasionally Squires came on inspection tours. She had never seen them close up but once, on a holiday, she had visited the City and seen a group of incredibly gorgeous creatures at a distance. Occasionally the mill-workers were allowed to listen to what educated people sounded like. They spoke differently, more fluently, with longer words and softer tones. Rik talked like that more and more as his memory improved. </strong></p><p><strong>She had been frightened at his first words. They came so suddenly after long whimpering over a headache. They were pronounced queerly. When she tried to correct him he wouldn&#x2019;t change. </strong></p><p><strong>Even then she had been afraid that he might remember too much and then leave her. She was only Valona March. They called her Big Lona. She had never married. She never would. A large, big- footed girl with work- reddened hands like herself could never marry. She had never been able to do more than look at the boys with dumb resentment when they ignored her at the idle- day dinner festivals. She was too big to giggle and smirk at them. </strong></p><p><strong>She would never have a baby to cuddle and hold. The other girls did, one after the other, and she could only crowd about for a quick glimpse of something red and hairless with screwed-up eyes, fists impotently clenched, gummy mouth&#x2014;&#x2014; </strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your turn next, Lona.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;When will you have a baby, Lona?&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>She could only turn away. </strong></p><p><strong>But when Rik had come, he was like a baby. He had to be fed and taken care of, brought out into the sun, soothed to sleep when the headaches racked him. </strong></p><p><strong>The children would run after her, laughing. They would yell, &#x201c;Lona&#x2019;s got a boy friend. Big Lona&#x2019;s got a crazy boy friend. Lona&#x2019;s boy friend is a rik.&#x201d; </strong></p><p><strong>Later on, when Rik could walk by himself (she had been as proud the day he took his first step as though he were really only one year old, instead of more like thirty- one) and stepped out, unescorted, into the village streets, they had run about him in rings, yelling their laughter and foolish ridicule in order to see a grown man cover his eyes in fear, and cringe, with nothing but whimpers to answer them. Dozens of times she had come charging out of the house, shouting at them, waving her large fists. </strong></p><p><strong>Even grown men feared those fists. She had felled her section head with a single wild blow the first day she had brought Rik to work at the mill because of a sniggering indecency concerning them which she overheard. The mill council fined her a week&#x2019;s pay for that incident, and might have sent her to the City for further trial at the Squire&#x2019;s court, but for the Townman&#x2019;s intervention and the plea that there had been p...</strong></p></p><h2>How to Restore Your Mustang 1964 1/2-1973</h2><p><p>The photos in this edition are black and white. </p><p>In the past, restoration guides have provided authenticity information, such as accurate paint codes, badges, wheels, and other equipment.

Young explores the religious and ritual practices that linked West-Central Africa with the Lowcountry region of Georgia and South Carolina during the era of slavery. The choice of these two sites mirrors the historical trajectory of the transatlantic slave trade which, for centuries, transplanted Kongolese captives to the Lowcountry through the ports of Charleston and Savannah. Analyzing the historical exigencies of slavery and the slave trade that sent not only men and women but also cultural meanings, signs, symbols, and patterns across the Atlantic, Young argues that religion operated as a central form of resistance against slavery and the ideological underpinnings that supported it. <br>Through a series of comparative chapters on Christianity, ritual medicine, burial practices, and transmigration, Young details the manner in which Kongolese people, along with their contemporaries and their progeny who were enslaved in the Americas, utilized religious practices to resist the savagery of the slave trade and slavery itself. When slaves acted outside accepted parameters -- in transmigration, spirit possession, ritual internment, and conjure -- Young explains, they attacked not only the condition of being a slave, but also the systems of modernity and scientific rationalism that supported slavery. In effect, he argues, slave spirituality played a crucial role in the resocialization of the slave body and behavior away from the oppressions and brutalities of the master class. Young's work expands traditional scholarship on slavery to include both the extensive work done by African historians and current interdisciplinary debates in cultural studies, anthropology, and literature.<br>Drawing on a wide range of primary sources from both American and African archives, including slave autobiography, folktales, and material culture, Rituals of Resistance offers readers a nuanced understanding of the cultural and religious connections that linked blacks in Africa with their enslaved contemporaries in the Americas. Moreover, Young's groundbreaking work gestures toward broader themes and connections, using the case of the Kongo and the Lowcountry to articulate the development of a much larger African Atlantic space that connected peoples, cultures, languages, and lives on and across the ocean's waters.</p></p><p><p>"A persuasive and fluid interpretation of slave culture, demonstrating the centrality of African-derived practices without presuming a static nature of socio-cultural development on either side of the Atlantic." -- Journal of Social History</p><p>In Rituals of Resistance Jason R.

But Newman was also an oddity in Hollywood: the rare box-office titan who cared about the craft of acting, the sexy leading man known for the staying power of his marriage, and the humble celebrity who made philanthropy his calling card long before it was cool. <br><br>The son of a successful entrepreneur, Newman grew up in a prosperous Cleveland suburb. Despite fears that he would fail to live up to his father&#x2019;s expectations, Newman bypassed the family sporting goods business to pursue an acting career. After struggling as a theater and television actor, Newman saw his star rise in a tragic twist of fate, landing the role of boxer Rocky Graziano in <i>Somebody Up There Likes Me</i> when James Dean was killed in a car accident. Though he would joke about instances of &#x201c;Newman&#x2019;s luck&#x201d; throughout his career, he refused to coast on his stunning boyish looks and impish charm. Part of the original Actors Studio generation, Newman demanded a high level of rigor and clarity from every project. The artistic battles that nearly derailed his early movie career would pay off handsomely at the box office and earn him critical acclaim. <br><br>He applied that tenacity to every endeavor both on and off the set. The outspoken Newman used his celebrity to call attention to political causes dear to his heart, including civil rights and nuclear proliferation. Taking up auto racing in midlife, Newman became the oldest driver to ever win a major professional auto race. A food enthusiast who would dress his own salads in restaurants, he launched the Newman&#x2019;s Own brand dedicated to fresh ingredients, a nonprofit juggernaut that has generated more than $250 million for charity.<br><br>In <i>Paul Newman: A Life</i>, film critic and pop culture historian Shawn Levy gives readers the ultimate behind-the-scenes examination of the actor&#x2019;s life, from his merry pranks on the set to his lasting romance with Joanne Woodward to the devastating impact of his son&#x2019;s death from a drug overdose. This definitive biography is a fascinating portrait of an extraordinarily gifted man who gave back as much as he got out of life and just happened to be one of the most celebrated movie stars of the twentieth century.</p><p>SHAWN LEVY is the author of six previous books, including the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>bestsellers&nbsp;<i>Rat Pack Confidential</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Paul Newman: A Life</i>.&nbsp; He served as film critic of&nbsp;<i>The Oregonian</i>&nbsp;from 1997 to 2012 and is a former senior editor of<i>American Film</i>&nbsp;and a former associate editor of&nbsp;<i>Box Office</i>.

Disheveled, with his spectacles perched on the tip of his nose and a vaguely distracted air, he&#x2019;s still rakishly handsome; clearly he was a corker in his time. He appears to have lived every vicissitude of life, and while experience hasn&#x2019;t entirely softened him, it has provided him a store of indulgence to mete out, judiciously but amiably, as he sees fit.

But such is his air of decency and authority that you find yourself hoping he deems you worthy.<br><br>George Gibbs, the youthful hero, is another matter: an all-American boy with muscles in his shoulders and, you can&#x2019;t help but suspect, in his head. His heart is in the right place, heaven knows, even if he must occasionally be reminded of just where that place is. He&#x2019;s a handsome thing, and enthusiasms burble out of him infectiously. His gaze is open, and his springy mien belies a real zest for life. But when he takes the time to notice smaller things or surprises himself by stumbling upon a sincere emotion, he turns puppyish. He even, caught up in the swell of love, croons; you wouldn&#x2019;t tune a piano to it, but it&#x2019;s sincere.<br><br>Their interactions are brief but memorable. At one moment the Stage Manager assumes the aspect of a biddy and lashes out at poor, dim George for tossing a ball to himself in the middle of the road. &#x201c;You got no business playing baseball on Main Street,&#x201d; he cackles in an old lady&#x2019;s voice, cowing the boy, and you reckon he&#x2019;s getting a kick out of his charade as the lad dutifully scampers off.<br><br>Later, when George escorts his sweetheart, Emily, to the drugstore for an ice cream soda, the Stage Manager takes the persona of Mr. Morgan, proprietor and counterman. Precisely and warmly, he crafts the fountain treats for the youngsters, and when it turns out that George has forgotten his pocket money at home, he refuses to accept the boy&#x2019;s gold watch as collateral for the debt: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll trust you ten years, George&#x2014;not a day over.&#x201d;<br><br>You sense affection in the older man and, equally, respect in the younger; the mutuality is warming. And as is so often the case, the warmth arises not only from the material but from the actors themselves &#x2014;a real coup of casting, in fact.<br><br>The old man has acted for Leo McCarey, who directed the Marx Brothers, and Michael Curtiz, who made Casablanca, and he appeared many times on live television during that medium&#x2019;s golden age. The kid has worked with the Coen Brothers and Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes and lent his voice to a big-budget Pixar movie and the video game version of it.<br><br>The old man is world famous: you can&#x2019;t go to the supermarket, the video store, or the Indianapolis Motor Speedway without encountering his image or his legacy. You think of Henry Fonda, Humphrey Bogart, and James Stewart as his equals. The kid is making a big name for himself, but he keeps getting compared to other actors, often as a way of dismissing him or counting him short: Marlon Brando, most often, and James Dean.<br><br>One has just turned thirty, has been married for six years, and has three children, the oldest not quite five. The other is seventy-eight, with his forty-fifth anniversary coming up and five grown daughters and a pair of grandkids with whom to celebrate it.<br><br>Physically, they share some traits: wavy hair, icy blue eyes, a classical handsomeness that looks patrician on the old fellow and preppy on the kid, and a springy grace that makes the young man seem coltish and the old man seem spry.<br><br>But their personalities are pretty distinct. The old guy is serious, a World War II vet who attended Kenyon College and the Yale School of Drama on the GI Bill and dreamed of becoming a teacher and takes an active part in politics; he&#x2019;s raised hundreds of millions of dollars for charity and served as president of the Actors Studio. The young guy is famous for his beer drinking and his practical jokes and his goofball sense of humor and his love of fast cars and motorcycles and his roles as antiauthoritarian rebels; he&#x2019;s already created a couple of parts on Broadway that have maintained a place in the national repertoire and made a few indelible TV dramas.<br><br>The older man you know: Paul Newman, playing the Stage Manager in the Westport County Playhouse production of Our Town as filmed at the Booth Theater on Broadway in early 2003.<br><br>And the younger man, well, you know him too: Paul Newman, playing George Gibbs in the same play, adapted as a musical for NBC television&#x2019;s Producers&#x2019; Showcase in September 1955.<br><br>Between those two performances sits an entire career and, indeed, an entire life&#x2014;not only of one man but of the culture in which he thrived.<br><br>The blind, impetuous vigor of youth; the wry, still acceptance of maturity; the progress of an artist in his craft; the maturation of a soul, a mind, a body; the life of a man and the half-century of history he lived and echoed and symbolized and even shaped: Paul Newman&#x2019;s story is all of it.<br><br>From a burgeoning Jazz Age suburb to a torpedo bomber in the Pacific, from the womb of academia to the free-for-all of Broadway and live TV, from the gilded cage of a Hollywood studio contract to the wild freedom of directing films for his own production company, from the filth and noise and danger of professional auto racing to the staid and venerable confines of the Philanthropy Hall of Fame, Paul Newman&#x2019;s life is a blazon of the American century, incorporating the very best national traits in a compact and comely package.<br><br>For fifty years, on-screen and off, Newman vividly embodied certain tendencies in the American male character: active and roguish and earnest and sly and determined and vulnerable and brave and humble and reliable and compassionate and fair. He was a man of his time, and that time ranged from World War II to the contemporary era of digitally animated feature films. He was equally at home on Hollywood soundstages, in theatrical workshops, in the pits of racetracks, and especially on the blessedly raucous fields and in the log cabins and swimming holes of the camps he built and maintained for seriously ill children. The world was his for the claiming&#x2014;and he claimed only the bit that he felt was reasonably due him, and he gave back more, by far, than he ever took.<br><br>He was ridiculously handsome and trim, with a face that belonged on an ancient coin, eyes that stunned and dazed even cynics, and an athlete&#x2019;s compact, lithe, and peppy body. Having fallen into acting as a profession, he would have been guaranteed at least minimal success by sheer virtue of his physical charms. If he&#x2019;d had no talent or tenacity or intellect or drive, he might still have enjoyed fame and riches. Put him in a dinner jacket, and he could sit confidently at table with presidents or poets or kings. He looked the part&#x2014;in fact, he looked any part, virtually, that he was asked to play.<br><br>But he was smart and cagey and suspicious of fortune too easily won, and he was scrupulous in distinguishing the things that came to him through luck from those he felt he&#x2019;d earned. He opted to live as far as reasonable from Hollywood, preferred barn coats and blue jeans to tuxedos, and chose the company of troupers and mechanics and beer- swillers over that of celebrities and swells and hobnobbers every time. There was crust and vinegar to him, and he relished the opportunity that his position in life afforded him to startle big shots with his sometimes downmarket tastes and preferences. And vice versa: he loved to sprinkle unexpected stardust in the humblest of contexts, just when he was taken for an ordinary joe.<br><br>He was, as he always insisted, a private man whose profession gave him a public face. And he grappled with the incongruity of that for a long time. If he was a cautious and shy fellow raised to a painfully puritanical ethos, he would learn to espouse his inner wildness by adapting personae&#x2014;in life and in art&#x2014;that camoflagued his insecurity and reticence in the cloth of exuberance and levity. If he was treated as a freak because of the inescapable fact that he was born beautiful, he would learn to turn that beauty into a tool of subterfuge, creating characters whose allure hid complex and painful depths. If his looks would make him a star, he would redirect that stardom into a benefit for others, slapping his face on labels for food products and creating staggering wealth&#x2014;then giving all the money away. If he was, regardless of his age, a sex symbol, he would work hard at being a good husband and father. If his personal wealth meant that he could take up motor sports at a high level, he would work as tenaciously at racing as he did at acting and earn acceptance in that world through sheer application and diligently acquired skill. If things came easily to him, he determined to share the benefit he accrued.<br><br>Few have lived fuller or richer lives than Paul Newman, and at the time of his death, the world seemed to take stock for the first time of all the Paul Newmans it had known: the actor, the driver, the public citizen, the entrepreneur, the philanthropist, the family man. But as Newman always knew, it all began with luck&#x2014;the genetics, upbringing, education, and career fortunes that uniquely enabled him to become a movie star. And it was as a movie star that he made his most obvious mark on the world.<br><br>In ways, he did it through the back door. Rarely appearing in obvious blockbusters, striving to reinvent himself by shedding his skin every few years, he compiled a cinematic r�sum� over five decades that was studded regularly with milestone films and performances: Somebody Up There Likes Me; The Long, Hot Summer; The Left Handed Gun; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof; Exodus; The Hustler; Paris Blues; Hud; Harper; Hombre; Cool Hand Luke; Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid; The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean; The Sting; The Towering Inferno; Buffalo Bill and the Indians; Slap Shot; Fort Apache the Bronx; Absence of Malice; The Verdict; The Color of Money; Blaze; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge; The Hudsucker Proxy; Nobody&#x2019;s Fool; Road to Perdition; Empire Falls; Cars. This is more than just a litany of estimable (and in some cases commercially gigantic) film titles. It&#x2019;s the trajectory of an actor determined to squirm away from preconceptions and to sharpen his artistic abilities at the same time. It stands against the very few similar lists of films ever compiled, and it spans eras, styles, generations. He wasn&#x2019;t the greatest American actor, and he was not even the greatest actor of his own vintage. But he was arguably the most American actor, the fellow whose roles and accumulated persona best captured the tenor of his times and his people.<br><br>Newman arrived in movies with the Method actor invaders of the 1950s and rode out their splashy heyday, becoming a commercial superstar while insistently pushing forward the boundaries of his craft. If you approached him initially only at the superficial level&#x2014;the level of beauty, as it were&#x2014;you might have mistaken him for Rock Hudson or Tony Curtis or Robert Wagner, handsome and capable, sure, but movie stars principally rather than craftsmen. Newman, though, had an internal discipline that demanded he make more of himself, and he earned, through sheer perseverance, a place alongside&#x2014;and in ways, above&#x2014;the Method gods Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and James Dean. He was ultimately the one true superstar to emerge from the original Actors Studio generation, the most popular and enduring Stanislavskyan actor in American screen history, the only one who could sit comfortably alongside big-time Golden Era movie stars and newfangled subversive interlopers.<br><br>And he was able to bridge the space between those two brands of actors for decades. In a half-century of movies, the characteristic Newman role morphed from almost-too-pretty to dangerously sleek to deliberately wily to weathered and weary-wise. At his best he played against his looks&#x2014;which may be why he is widely regarded as improving as an actor as he aged. And his instinct to cut against himself meant that he couldn&#x2019;t personify scions of wealth and privilege as well as he could ordinary men struggling with quotidian issues&#x2014;particularly the struggles of fathers and sons who couldn&#x2019;t communicate adequately or, indeed, love each other enough. Even though he was a partner in a famed half-century marriage, he rarely played a romantic lead and, truly, never all that well. Rather, he played broken athletes, half- crazed outlaws, cocky scam artists, insouciant iconoclasts, and a long skein of rascally and unreliable private eyes, liquor salesmen, cops, spies, lawyers, loggers, and construction workers. Very occasionally&#x2014; and perhaps only to satisfy a seemingly visceral need to avoid repeating himself&#x2014;he played men of ramrod morality and authority whose positions as social leaders belied their failures as human beings; predictably, as with so many other types he essayed, he nailed them.<br><br>Taken as a whole, Newman&#x2019;s body of work nicely encapsulated the history of an in-between generation of American men who helped their fathers and uncles conquer the world in war and commerce but who could only watch on&#x2014;likely with some jealousy&#x2014;as their younger siblings and their own children acted out on the native rebellious impulse to overturn everything. He fit in precisely with neither the Greatest Generation nor the Baby Boomers but represented instead a vital link in the American century&#x2014;a band of men who were meant to inherit a system that was no longer reliably in place by the time their fathers willed it to them. Torn by the conflicting impulses to rule and rebel, his was arguably the pivotal generation of the twentieth century, and Newman, almost unconsciously, was its actor laureate.</p><h2>SoulShift: The Measure of a Life Transformed</h2><p><p>We want to be different, but we don't want to change.

On any given day, seemingly by whim, the weather is balmy and sweet-smelling and can lure reluctant smiles from the hopeful who dream of cool, tart drinks on steamy afternoons, creamy white magnolia blossoms and scented offshore breezes. Then overnight, everything can change. With a sudden gust of cold wind, winter will reach out with its icy grip to draw a foggy curtain over the gray marsh.<br><br>Mama June Blakely had hoped for an early spring, but she was well seasoned and had learned to keep an eye on the sky for dark clouds. A leaden mist hovered close to the water, so thick that Mama June could barely make out Blakely's Bluff, which stretched out into the gray-green Atlantic Ocean like a defiant fist. A bittersweet smile eased across her lips. She'd always thought it a fitting symbol of her family's turbulent history with the sea.<br><br>Perched high on the bluff was a weather-beaten house that had been in the Blakely family for generations. Bluff House had withstood countless hurricanes and storms to remain the bastion of family gatherings long after most of the old Charleston family's land holdings were sold off. Each time Mama June looked at the battered house, waves of memories crashed against her stony composure. And when the wind gusted across the marshes, as it did now, she thought the mist swirled like ghosts dancing on the tips of cordgrass.<br><br>Thunder rumbled, low and threatening. She tugged her sweater closer to her neck and shifted her gaze to the lowering skies. Weather moved quickly over the South Carolina coastline, and a front like that could bring a quick cloudburst and sudden winds. Worry tugged at her mouth as she turned on her heel and made her way across the polished floors of her home, through the large, airy kitchen, the stocked butler's pantry, the formal dining room with glistening crystal and mirrors, the front parlor appointed with ancestral furniture and straight out to the front veranda. Gripping the porch railing, she leaned far forward, squinting as she searched the length of ancient roadbed bordered by centuries-old oaks.<br><br>Her frown lifted when she spotted a broad, snowy-headed figure walking up the drive, a lanky black dog at his heels. Mama June leaned against the porch pillar, sighing in relief. At that pace, she figured Preston would beat the storm. How many years had she watched and waited for her husband to come in from the fields? Goodness, could it really be nearing fifty years?<br><br>Preston Blakely wasn't a large man physically, but his manner and personality made him imposing to anyone who knew him. People called him formidable in polite company, bullheaded in familiar&#x2014;and she couldn't argue. He was walking with a single-minded purpose, heels digging in the soft roadbed and arms swinging. His square chin jutted out, cutting the wind like the mast of a ship.<br><br>Lord, what bee was in that man's britches this time? she thought with a sorry shake of her head.<br><br>On reaching the house, Preston sent the dog to the back with a jerk of his index finger. "Go on, now. Settle, Blackjack," he ordered. Then, raising his head, he caught Mama June's gaze.<br><br>"Hellfire," he grumbled louder than the thunder, raising his arm and shaking a fistful of crumpled papers in the air. "They've gone and done it this time."<br><br>Mama June's hands tightened on the railing as her husband came up the porch stairs. "Done what?"<br><br>"They done got me by the short hairs," he said on reaching the porch.<br><br>"Who got you, dear?"<br><br>"The banks!" he roared. "The taxes. The whole cussed economy, that's who!"<br><br>"Sit down a spell, Press, before you pop a valve. Look at you. You're sweating under that slicker. It's too hot for such a fuss and, I swanny&#x2014;" she waved her small hand in the air "&#x2014;I don't know what you're talking about. Taxes and banks and short hairs..."<br><br>"I'm talking about this place!"<br><br>"There's no need to shout. I'm old, not deaf."<br><br>"Then listen to what I'm tellin' you, woman. We're going to lose it."<br><br>"What? Lose the land?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am, the land," he said. "And this house you're so fond of. We'll lose it all."<br><br>"Press," she replied, striving for calm. "I don't understand any of this. How can we lose everything?"<br><br>Preston leaned against the railing and looked out over his land. A cool wind rippled the wild grasses like waves upon the ocean.<br><br>"Remember when we were reassessed a few months past?" When she nodded, he continued. "Well, here's what they say this property is worth now. And here's how much they say we've got to pay. Go on," he said, waving the papers before her. "Read it and weep."<br><br>Mama June reached out to retrieve the crumpled papers and gingerly unfolded them. Her mouth slipped open in a soft gasp. "But...this can't be right. It's three times as much as before."<br><br>"Four times as much."<br><br>"We can't afford that. We'll appeal. They can't force us to accept this."<br><br>"They can and they will."<br><br>"There are lots of folks round here that won't stand for it," Mama June said, hearing aloud the indignation she felt stirring in her breast. "This can't just be happening to us."<br><br>"That's true enough. It's happening all over. And there's nothing any of us can do. Folks keep coming from the north in a steady stream." He shrugged. "And they all want to live along the water for the beautiful views. Trouble is, there's only so much property to go around. So property values just keep climbing and developers, like my own sweet, avaricious sister, are licking their chomps just biding their time. They'll wrestle away any and every acre of earth so they can turn around and plow it over with cement." He raked his thick, short white hair with his fingers. "Hell, I knew it was coming&#x2014;we all did. I reckon I just didn't think it would be so quick."<br><br>He gave a rueful smile. "Kinda like a hurricane, eh? Well," he said with resignation, "looks like we miscalculated on this one. Just like we did with Hugo."<br><br>"We've always managed to hang on before. Through the war, the gas crisis, the bad economy, even Hurricane Hugo."<br><br>"I know it. I've done my best&#x2014;God knows I've fought the good fight. But I'm old now. And I'm worn out. I don't have it in me to fight them anymore."<br><br>Mama June stepped forward to rest her hand on his drooping shoulder, alarmed to her core to see her usual bear of a husband so defeated. She was about to offer some platitude, to say "don't worry, we'll be fine," when she felt his shoulders cord up again beneath her palms. He exploded in renewed fury.<br><br>"Maybe if that no-good son of ours had stayed home we wouldn't be in this mess."<br><br>Mama June dropped her hand and wrapped her arms around herself. "Let's don't start in on Morgan..."<br><br>"Don't you go defending him," he said, whirling around to face her. "Not to me! He's my son, dammit. He should be here, helping his father run this plantation. It's too much for one man. I need his ideas, his energy. Is it too much to ask my only son to take his father's place?"<br><br>"He needs to take his own place in the world," she countered softly, even as she felt herself harden against her husband. This was an all-too-familiar argument.<br><br>"The hell with the world! It's Sweetgrass that needs him. It's his duty. His heritage! A Blakely has run Sweetgrass Plantation for eight generations, and though there may only be a few hundred acres left, by God, Sweetgrass is still in Blakely hands."<br><br>"He's got his own land," she reminded him.<br><br>"His own land?" Preston's eyes widened with incredulity. "You mean those few measly acres in the wilds of Montana that he hides out in when he's not out breaking some laws?"<br><br>"Oh, for pity's sake. He's not doing any such thing. He's protesting!"<br><br>"And for what? To protect some bison? Hell," he said with a snort. <em>"Bison...</em>He grew up calling them buffalo like the rest of us."<br><br>"He's trying to protect them."<br><br>"He's playing around. He's not working that land. He's not working, period."<br><br>"Stop, Press." His angry words were shredding her composure like razors.<br><br>"Worthless," he muttered, ignoring her.<br><br>She turned and began walking away. "I can't listen to this...."<br><br>"What did I bother working for all these years?" he called after her. "That's what I want to know. I have no one to pass this all down to."<br><br>She stopped and faced him with a cold stare. "You have your daughter."<br><br>Preston scoffed and brushed away the suggestion with a sweep of his hand.<br><br>"You can't keep brushing Nan aside."<br><br>"Didn't she do just that to us when she sold off her land?"<br><br>"Her husband..."<br><br>"That weasel! He only married her for her land."<br><br>"What a thing to say!" She'd thought as much herself but had never granted it voice. "Lest you forget, I sold my land when I married you."<br><br>"That wasn't the same thing at all, and you know it."<br><br>"I know no such thing."<br><br>"See, there you go. You always take their sides over mine."<br><br>"I do no&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'm your husband! <em>I </em>should be your first concern. For once! I've worked all these years like a bull in the harness to keep this land intact, to keep hold of this house with all those antiques you love so much."<br><br>"Don't even..."<br><br>"All of this." His arm swept out in a grand gesture. "I've sweated from dawn to dusk. I've spilled blood. I've given my heart and soul to this place. My dreams. My youth. And now..." He stopped, clamping his lips tight and looking out at the land with desperation shining moistly in his eyes. "And now it's gone."<br><br>"Good!" she replied with heart.<br><br>Preston spun around to look at her. "What'd you say?"<br><br>"You heard me. I <em>said good. </em>Good riddance!" she cried out with a strained voice. She saw the pale blue of his eyes swimming with pain and shock at her outburst. But rather than take it back or soften the words, as she ordinarily might have done, she felt years of anguish burst forth with a volcanic gush.<br><br>"All you think about is the loss of this <em>land!" </em>she cried, thrusting the papers into the paunch of his belly. "What about your family? What about that loss? You haven't spoken with your son in years. Your daughter feels like a pariah. They don't come around anymore. You've <em>driven </em>our children away. But you don't care about that, do you? You didn't fight to keep the family, did you? All you care about is this piece of earth. Well, it won't be long before we'll die and be buried on this precious land. But who will mourn our passing? I ask you, Preston, will our children weep when we're gone?"<br><br>His face went still before he swung his head away, averting his gaze.<br><br>She took a breath to gather her strength and stepped closer to her husband, narrowing the distance. Pounding her breast with her fist, emphasizing each word, she said in a voice betrayed by a shaky timbre, "This land has stolen my children from me. And that is a far greater loss to me. Good riddance, I say. I despise this land!"<br><br>"You don't mean that." Preston's voice was low and husky.<br><br>She took a long, sweeping glance at the landscape she'd called home for close to five decades. The roiling line of clouds rolled overhead like the closing of a curtain. Then she met his gaze and held it.<br><br>"I surely do. From the day I first stepped foot on it, all this land ever brought me was utter and complete heartbreak."<br><br>They stood face-to-face, silently recollecting the wide swath of years cut low by that statement.<br><br>Around them the storm broke. Fat drops of rain splattered loudly on the dry ground in gaining crescendo. With each gust of wind the grasses swayed and shook, rattling like castanets. Then the sky opened up and the heavens cried. The roof provided no shelter from the torrents of rain, and both felt the lash of water that whipped through the air.<br><br>Mama June doubted the rain hid from Preston the tears coursing a trail down her cheeks. Yet he did not move to console her or offer any word of either argument or comfort. Her shoulders slumped and she retreated inside the house.<br><br>Preston stood rock still and watched her go. He was unmov-ing as he listened to his wife's tread on the stairs, knowing she made her way to her bedroom. She would likely cloister herself for hours, perhaps for the rest of the evening, shutting him out.<br><br>Same as always.<br><br>He wouldn't go after her, wouldn't try to talk things through lest the words dredged up the past. She couldn't handle that, and he didn't know if <em>he </em>could anymore, either. Besides, it wasn't worth the risk of her retreating to a place far more inaccessible than her bedroom.<br><br>He sighed heavily, her name slipping through his lips. "Mary June..."<br><br>He'd spoken harshly and was sorry for it. She was delicate when it came to matters of the family. He'd always tried to shelter her from bad news. But this...He squeezed the papers once more in his fist. <em>This </em>had hit too hard. He couldn't bear this alone. Hellfire, he'd needed someone to share this burden with, and who better than his wife? She <em>was </em>his wife, wasn't she?<br><br>He cast a final glance up toward her room, where she was crying, and knew a sudden pain, as if the lightning in the sky just shot through his heart.<br><br>"To hell with it!" he cried, drawing back his hand and throwing the cursed papers into the storm.<br><br>The wind caught the papers, hurtling them toward the marsh faster than a Cooper's hawk. They landed, tangled in the tall grasses, beaten by the rain. Lightning flashed in the blackening sky, and by the time he heard the rumble of thunder, he was in the house, reaching for the snifter of brandy.<br><br>The storm passed quickly on its march from the mainland to the sea. Now the air was fresh and the pastel pinks of the sunset had deepened to a rich ocher. Preston sat on the porch, his clothes damp and his skin cold, staring out at the purpling sky while the brandy did its work. Usually Mama June sat rocking beside him in a companionable silence. He felt her absence deeply.<br><br>"At least you're here, aren't you, boy?" he said, reaching down to pat the black Labrador retriever curled at his feet. Blackjack, who had sneaked back onto the porch the moment Mama June left, raised his dark, melting eyes and gazed at Preston with devotion while his tail thumped with affection.

The <i>Summa Contra Gentiles</i> is commonly thought to be composed with a missionary intention, possibly for the use of Thomas's brethren in their work of explaining the faith to non-Christians, especially Muslims in Spain. This volume contains the first and second books of the <i>Summa Contra Gentiles</i>. Book 1 treats of God in himself as reason can know him.

The introduction brings this classic up to date - not that it has ever fallen out of date or ever will. The title comes from Mises&#39;s description of the reality of central planning and socialism, whether of the national variety (Nazism) or the international variety (communism). Rather than create an orderly society, the attempt to central plan has precisely the opposite effect. By short-circuiting the price mechanism and forcing people into economic lives contrary to their own chosing, central planning destroys the capital base and creates economic randomness that eventually ends in killing prosperity. This important work was written decades after Mises&#39;s original essay on economic calculation and includes the broadest and boldest attack on all forms of state control.</p><p></p><h2>Mayflower Descendants and Their Marriages for Two Generations After Landing: Including A Short History of the Church of the Pilgrim Founders of New England (Historic Editions)</h2><p>Mayflower Descendants and Their Marriages for Two Generations After the Landing including a short history of the Church of the Pilgrim Founders of New England</p><p></p><h2>Healing Multiple Sclerosis: Diet, Detox &amp; Nutritional Makeover for Total Recovery, New Revised Edition</h2><p>This new, expanded edition (revised in 2014) gives a breakthrough treatment protocol that can restore health to those with multiple sclerosis.

I had undergone two weeks of tests hoping to learn what was causing the spasms, numbness, tingling, and other neurological symptoms that had left me barely able to walk on my own. "Well, Ann," he said, "the good news is, you don't have cancer. The bad news is . . . you have multiple sclerosis." With those words, I became a statistic, one of an estimated three million people worldwide--500,000 in the United States alone--who are afflicted by the debilitating disease of multiple sclerosis. <br><br> ". . . incurable . . . experiment with chemotherapy . . . slow the inevitable deterioration. . . ." <br><br>He went on speaking, but I was in such shock that his words made no sense to me. Traditional Western medicine had failed to cure me of serious mononucleosis five years earlier. I had no confidence that it could help me now. <br><br>I left his office, and after two weeks of physical suffering, mental turmoil, and emotional torture, I turned my back on the traditional medical treatments for MS. I was only twenty-four, and terrified, but I refused to accept the prospect of spending my life in a wheelchair. "I will not be another MS statistic," I promised myself. And slowly, bit by bit, I created my own self-care program based on integrative medicine methods. <br><br>Four tumultuous years later, I reversed MS. <br><br>You must understand that health is more than just the physical body. Health means a balance of the body, mind, emotions, and spirit. When you experience a chronic disease, all facets of the self must be examined. This means moving beyond the symptoms to address diet, lifestyle, stress, exercise, negative thoughts, fear-based emotions, and self-limiting belief systems. <br><br>Eventually, I hope, the usual paradigm in Western medi�cine will shift to a realization that even if two people have the same disease, they must be treated as individuals based on the knowledge that each person's history is unique, that health is more than just treating the physical body, and that it is essen�tial to go to the root cause. Then cures will be the rule, not the exception to the rule. <br><br>Most important, health is a choice. Yes, the body has an innate inner intelligence that works at keeping itself balanced through the process known as homeostasis. But this is not enough to maintain health if you are making unhealthy choices, entertaining negative thoughts, bombarding your body with depleted foods, overwhelming it with stress, and holding on to fear-based emotions. Whenever you make the apparently simple choice of what to eat each day, you are actually choosing whether you want health--or not. <br><br>Even as I took the first steps on my healing journey, it was clear to me that I would be moving not only toward achieving recovery, but also toward helping others to move through the complexities of autoimmune disease. Today I am a nutritionist and naturopath with a fifteen-year practice, during which I've seen thousands of clients for various health conditions. Based on both my personal and my professional experience, it is my responsibility, and my passion, not just to educate you about the causes of MS and how to reverse it, but also to inspire you with the knowledge that you can triumph. <br><br>Society, your family, and your peers have more or less con�ditioned you to believe that you are powerless when it comes to MS--that drugs are your only option for living with this diagnosis. That is not so. There is a hidden truth to healing that has always been with us. This truth is the incredible in�dividual power you possess to transform yourself--your body, your spirit, your mind, and your emotions. Making a choice to become healthy and then backing it up with belief and convic�tion are the keys to coming into your own power and turning around any disease. <br><br>This book is presented in four sections: <br><br><li>Part One, "My Healing Journey," recounts my personal transformational journey and how I cured MS. </li><li>Part Two, "The Real Cause of Multiple Sclerosis," describes all the causes of MS. </li><li>Part Three, "You Can Heal Yourself: The Solutions," explains the solutions and why they are effective. </li><li>Part Four, "Your Treatment Plan," gives you user-friendly charts, recipes, and exercises so you can create your own self-help treatment program.</li><b>Excerpt from the Foreword by Ann Louise Gittleman, PhD, CNS,</b><br> <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Fat Flush Plan, Before the Change,</i> and <i>The Fast Track One-Day Detox Diet</i>: <br><br> The body is an incredible system with an infinite capacity to heal, provided that we lessen our toxic load and provide the right nourishment and environment for regeneration to occur. . . . Over the past sixty years, our diets, lifestyles, and environment have undergone a revolution, placing a huge burden on our body's detoxification organs. . . . <br><br>And so I am very pleased to say that Ann Boroch's book is right on the mark! Her tumultuous four-year journey of reversing multiple sclerosis taught her firsthand to examine the layers that the body and mind take on to create disease. The result of her journey is a landmark book that identifies and unifies seemingly unrelated "root" causes that go beyond petrochemicals--and that targets . . . underlying hidden factors present in almost all autoimmune diseases. Best of all, Ms. Boroch provides workable natural solutions for a practical self-help program that anybody with a desire to get well can follow. <br><br>Written in four parts, consisting of her personal journey, the causes of MS, and the solutions, Ms. Boroch's book also provides a wonderful treatment section chock-full of user-friendly charts, supplementation programs, recipes, and resources. <br><br>Ann Boroch will inspire and enlighten you. By following her program, you will not only experience more energy, heightened vitality, and mental clarity, but your overall health is sure to improve. Ms. Boroch is to be congratulated for her courage and knowledge that disease is a wake-up call to clean up your act from the inside out!</p><h2>Ugly Americans: The True Story of the Ivy League Cowboys Who Raided the Asian Markets for Millions</h2><p><p>Ben Mezrich, author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <i>Bringing Down the House</i>, returns with an astonishing story of Ivy League hedge-fund cowboys, high stakes, and the Asian underworld.</p> <p>John Malcolm was the ultimate gunslinger in the Wild East, prepared to take on any level of risk in making mind-boggling sums of money. He and his friends were hedge-fund cowboys, living life on the adrenaline-, sex-, and drugs-fueled edge&#x2014;kids running billion-dollar portfolios, trading information in the back rooms of high-class brothels and at VIP tables in nightclubs across the Far East.</p> <p>Malcolm and his Ivy League-schooled twenty-something colleagues, with their warped sense of morality, created their own economic theory that would culminate in a single deal the likes of which had never been seen before&#x2014;or since.</p> <p><i>Ugly Americans</i> is a story of extremes, charged with wealth, nerve, excess, and glamour. A real-life mixture of <em>Liar's Poker</em> and <em>Wall Street</em>, brimming with intense action, romance, underground sex, vivid locales, and exotic characters, <i>Ugly Americans</i> is the untold true story that rocked the financial community.</p></p><p><i>Ugly Americans</i> documents the "Wild East" of the mid-1990s, where young, brilliant, and hypercompetitive traders became "hedge fund cowboys," manipulating loopholes in an outdated and inefficient Asian financial system to rake in millions. Using a concept called arbitrage, they made their fortunes mainly on minute shifts in stocks being sold on the Nikkei, the Japanese stock market, collapsing banks and nearly bankrupting the Japanese economy in the process. Other schemes were also concocted, most of which were technically legal, though certainly unethical. This true story revolves around "John Malcolm," who, in exchange for anonymity, agreed to give Ben Mezrich all the access and information he needed to write this book. As a recent Princeton graduate in the mid-1990s, Malcolm accepted an undefined job offer from an American expatriate in Japan to work in the investments field. Though he had no prior experience, he facilitated 25 million dollars worth of trades on his first day on the job, and it just got more exciting from there. He soon joined a small group of expatriates, all in their twenties and mostly Ivy League graduates, who lived like rock stars, thriving on the stress and excitement of their jobs to create their own steroid versions of the American Dream half a world away. Mezrich tells this riveting story well, incorporating elements of the culture into his narrative, including the infamous and pervasive Japanese "Water Trade," or sex business, romantic intrigue, and even run-ins with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. Though there is little real analysis of their financial dealings and how they ultimately changed the rules of finance in Asia, this entertaining page turner does offer a glimpse into a world little explored in print until now. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i><p>Ben Mezrich graduated <em>magna cum laude</em> from Harvard in 1991. He has published twelve books, including the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>The Accidental Billionaires</em>, which was adapted into the Academy Award-winning film <em>The Social Network</em>, and <em>Bringing Down the House</em>, which has sold more than 1.5 million copies in twelve languages and became the basis for the Kevin Spacey movie <em>21</em>.

It is about providing that "something enduring to hold close, something that won't wash away in the furious tides of change." </p><p>The wise philosopher, Alan Watts, points out that there is <i>the feeling</i> that we live in a time of <i>unusual</i> insecurity. He attributes this feeling to the many new technologies with which science and industry are bombarding us. He also attributes it to the many long held traditions that have broken down relative to family life, religion, and the world of work. Now here's the surprise . . . Watts made these observations in 1951! </p><p>I would venture to say that the feeling of insecurity has greatly escalated since those seemingly "good old days"! Since then we have lived through many events that have further eroded our sense of security, none more startling and upsetting than the destruction by terrorists of the World Trade Centers in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington on September 11, 2001. So many people from all over the world lost their lives. And so many lost people they dearly loved. What happened on this historic day has had the effect of putting the entire world on a state of alert. For how long? Only time will tell.* </p><p>*This horrific terrorist attack took place just as I was completing this book.

High quality 8.5 by 11 in. paperbacks made to lie flat and last on your workbench.</p></p><p>Henry Strobel is the author-publisher of seven books on violin, viola, and cello making, repair, and adjustment, which are used worldwide. He recently published a video <i>Watch Me Make a Cello, Step by Step.</i> Born in Indiana in 1936, he had a first career as an electronic design engineer, and was one of the founders of Digital Telephone Systems, Inc. in California, which manufactured transmission and switching equipment. He served in the US Air Force service in Scotland as a communications officer. He studied violin as a schoolboy, made his first over thirty years ago, and has had his own violin business for twenty years, fifteen at his current full service violin shop in Oregon, where, with his wife and sons, he also makes violins, violas, and cellos, and writes books.Preface to the First Edition This is a simple, short, practical handbook. It outlines the essential steps in making a violin. Six years ago, in the preface to <i>Useful Measurements for Violin Makers</i>, I had suggested that there were already enough "how to make a violin" books. I know better now, although I was not eager to begin this book that so many of you suggested. It's even harder to write down these "steps" with inspiration and freshness than it is to make a violin that way. Simplicity and brevity preclude completeness, except in essentials, and every established maker already has his own methods that perhaps differ from those selected for this book. To keep it simple and short, but still clear and consistent, I have presented primarily one way - certainly not the only good way. At least this was my original intent, but as I wrote, I frequently found myself mentioning alternate ways, in brackets and small type, [like this]. The methods given are simple and mostly traditional, but do not necessarily follow any one school to the letter. The outline pattern offered here is simply a good example, taken from a violin that was at hand; use any other that you like. Although I have made relatively few instruments, I have examined or repaired a multitude, and studied in depth much of the literature of violin making. "Ars longa, vita brevis." There is little new here, but the organization and writing are my own, grounded throughout on my own experience. I include references to my other books in this series, which many readers already have, to avoid duplication of material. This book is basic and reliable, unburdened by conjecture, "secrets", or "science". I did my best, within the limits of my knowledge, expertise, and time. I welcome your suggestions or corrections for future editions. Far better craftsmen than I have been making violins this way for hundreds of years. But most of them didn't write books. Countless violins, superficially similar, have been made by thousands of makers, whose relative artistry is restricted to a narrow range and then subjectively judged. It is hard to stand out when we are all making essentially the same thing. Violin makers, rather rare fifty years ago, are everywhere today. A school can teach technical competence, perhaps not artistry. A book can insure neither, but it can help some readers avoid obstacles and eccentricity in reinventing this wonderful wheel. Making a mere fiddle is a trivial task, making an artist's instrument is not. This book does: <p>Provide the beginner a consistent, convenient outline of the essential steps. </p><p>Organize and review the process for the experienced but occasional maker. </p><p> It does not: </p><p>Specify details of style and finish that are properly personal to the individual maker. </p><p>Insure making a beautiful or good sounding violin, which depends on many things. </p><p>It assumes that: </p><p>The maker is a dedicated, disciplined craftsman and a student of art, whatever his age. </p><p>He has the artistic taste, musical sensibility, and interest to pursue his art. Making a fine violin is more than copying, more than following directions. It is the individual completion of an artist's plan. It fills two needs: that of the violinist who wants a special instrument, beautiful in form and function, and that of the maker who is moved to create it.</p></p><h2>Shaking Up Prohibition in New Orleans: Authentic Vintage Cocktails from A to Z</h2><p><p>In the 1920s Prohibition was the law, but ignoring it was the norm, especially in New Orleans. While popular writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald invented partygoers who danced from one cocktail to the next, real denizens of the French Quarter imbibed their way across the city. Bringing to life the fiction of flappers with tastes beyond bathtub gin, Shaking Up Prohibition in New Orleans: Authentic Vintage Cocktails from A to Z serves up recipes from the era of the speakeasy. </p><p>Originally assembled by Olive Leonhardt and Hilda Phelps Hammond around 1929, this delightful compendium applauds the city's irrepressible love for cocktails in the format of a classic alphabet book. Leonhardt, a noted artist, illustrated each letter of the alphabet, while Hammond provided cocktail recipes alongside tongue-in-cheek poems that jab at the dubious scenario of a "dry" New Orleans. A cultural snapshot of the Crescent City's resistance to Prohibition, this satirical, richly illustrated book brings to life the spirit and spirits of a jazz city in the Jazz Age. </p><p>With an introduction on Prohibition-era New Orleans by historian John Magill and biographical profiles of Leonhardt and Hammond by editor Gay Leonhardt, readers can fully appreciate the setting and the personalities behind this vintage cocktail guide with a Big Easy bent. </p><p>A perfect gift for lovers (and makers) of craft cocktails, arbiters of style, and celebrants of the Crescent City, Shaking Up Prohibition in New Orleans captures the essence of the Roaring Twenties.</p></p><p><p>Known for illustrating the covers of the literary magazine The Double Dealer and for her book New Orleans, Drawn and Quartered, OLIVE LEONHARDT (1895-1963) was an illustrator and artist who attended Newcomb College, the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts, and the Art Students League. </p><p>HILDA PHELPS HAMMOND (1890-1951) met Olive Leonhardt through mutual friends at Newcomb, and they socialized in art salons, at Junior League events, and at marches for the suffrage movement in New Orleans. A graduate of Tulane University, Hammond organized the Women's Committee of Louisiana and is remembered as an outspoken critic of Governor Huey P. Long.</p></p><h2>Stars: A Fully Illustrated, Authoritative and Easy-to-Use Guide (A Golden Guide from St. Martin&#39;s Press)</h2><p><p>Enjoy the wonders of the heavens and understand more fully what you see.

By tying impact to tools and techniques, through real-life stories, we hope to help decision makers better understand how to use customer data while helping data analysis providers understand how to create output that end users will value.This book provides 52 real-life anecdotes that illustrate important learnings about customer analytics. It draws from the worlds of big data and customer insights. It is our contribution to help managers do a better job using customer analytics (what to do and what not to do) so that the analytics actually makes a difference.Books on customer analytics (data science, business analysis, market research, whatever you like to call it) primarily exist in two categories: as academic texts, which discuss theoretical approaches to data analysis problems; or as technical texts, which teach the statistics or computer programming required to conduct an analysis. As the focus of these books is on analysis tools and techniques, fictitious examples are often used to explain main topics. Our book fills in the missing gap between these approaches by providing real-life, practical stories, tying analysis directly to business value.---"Essential reading for those who want to cut through all the hype of big data. This book has practical advice on how to have real financial and business impact, from the experienced authors who have done this in real life."John ForsythFormer Principal (Partner), McKinsey, former Head, McKinsey&#x2019;s Global Customer Insights Practice---"Mike and Alex have delivered an entertaining and highly readable romp through many aspects of customer analysis&#x2014;from qualitative focus groups through to terrabytes of big data; and utilizing many real-world examples to reinforce their points. They employ a relentless focus on the use of analysis to deliver meaningful and impactful business value ... and that should matter to you, too, whether you&#x2019;re the CEO, the product owner or a junior analyst delivering the work."George HaylettFormer Asia Analytics Head for Amex, Citibank and HSBC---"Significance. Reliability. Confidence. These and other such terms can be a mantra for both suppliers and buyers of data and analytics. Whether it be big data, qualitative research or something in between; sampling, statistics and &#x201c;findings&#x201d; are often the drivers of customer or business analytic exercises. But what about relevance? If the results cannot direct business decisions, what does it matter how &#x201c;accurate&#x201d; they are? Used correctly, such analytics are an enormously powerful driver of business performance and profitability. But only if the findings have business salience or business significance. Otherwise, aren&#x2019;t they just another type of BS? In this book, Mike and Alex Sherman lay out some wonderful examples of how the time and money spent on business analytics can transform decision-making or be a complete waste of time. It contains great lessons for buyers and users of such services. But I would also commend it to consultants and suppliers. We shouldn&#x2019;t need to sell what a computer can do with data. We should be promoting what humans and businesses can do by asking the right questions of the results."Adrian ChedoreFormer CEO of Synovate---"This book thoughtfully and practically reminds us that, as we continue to further automate consumer insight analytics efforts with the newest analytics and AI technology, human thinking and human understanding of the fundamental purpose of the analysis, and of the questions that are essential to understanding that purpose, becomes even more important."Professor Steven MillerVice Provost (Research), Singapore Management University</p><p></p><h2>A Teacher&#39;s Guide to Adapted Physical Education: Including Students With Disabilities in Sports and Recreation, Fourth Edition</h2><p>A healthy, active lifestyle for all students: That's the promise of physical education, and the goal of this comprehensive textbook.

They are found virtually everywhere and we love to watch them, listen to them, keep them as pets, wear their feathers, even converse with them. Birds, Jim Robbins posits, are our most vital connection to nature. They compel us to look to the skies, both literally and metaphorically; draw us out into nature to seek their beauty; and let us experience vicariously what it is like to be weightless. Birds have helped us in so many of our human endeavors: learning to fly, providing clothing and food, and helping us better understand the human brain and body. And they even have much to teach us about being human in the natural world.<br><br> This book illuminates qualities unique to birds that demonstrate just how invaluable they are to humankind&#x2014;both ecologically and spiritually. The wings of turkey buzzards influenced the Wright brothers&#x2019; flight design; the chickadee&#x2019;s song is considered by scientists to be the most sophisticated language in the animal world and a &#x201c;window into the evolution of our own language and our society&#x201d;; and the quietly powerful presence of eagles in the disadvantaged neighborhood of Anacostia, in Washington, D.C., proved to be an effective method for rehabilitating the troubled young people placed in charge of their care.<br><br> Exploring both cutting-edge scientific research and our oldest cultural beliefs, Robbins moves these astonishing creatures from the background of our lives to the foreground, from the quotidian to the miraculous, showing us that we must fight to save imperiled bird populations and the places they live, for the sake of both the planet and humankind.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Wonder of Birds</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A must-read, conveying much necessary information in easily accessible form and awakening one&#x2019;s consciousness to what might otherwise be taken for granted . . . <i>The Wonder of Birds</i> reads like the story of a kid let loose in a candy store and given free rein to sample.

Did it spring, fully formed, with perfect wings, from the mind of God? Or was the first act of flying carried out by a small dinosaur with feathers who leaped out of a tree, glided gently through the air, and landed on the ground like a child&#x2019;s balsa airplane? Did a galloping feathered dinosaur chase so fast after a buzzing insect, leaping to gobble it, that it found itself airborne? How flight first happened is a mystery, but in the birds that surround us today, which are the only surviving dinosaur lineage, some have found a look back at how dinosaurs might have gone airborne and what these creatures from long ago were like.<br><br>The governing theories about how the first animal evolved the ability to fly&#x2014;first proposed in the nineteenth century and still operable today&#x2014;are divided into two main camps, the arboreal and the cursorial. Derived from the Latin word for &#x201c;tree,&#x201d; the arboreal theory holds that around 125 million years ago, small reptilelike creatures with four limbs were covered with something like feathers. The featherlike covering was used not for flying but as a cloak to keep the creatures warm or as a way to look sexy and attract partners, or as camouflage, or all three. Perhaps these creatures leaped from tree to tree in a dense rainforest, the way a flying squirrel travels&#x2014;not really flying, but gliding.<br><br>Then one day, arborealists imagine, with its forelimbs stretched in front of it and its feather coverings spread out to the side, the first flying animal glided from a tree to the ground, and as it went on it added flapping to increase thrust. Perhaps the critter had a random genetic mutation that gave it larger forelimbs than others, which helped propel the animal forward. There are some sticky problems, however, that some argue shoot down the trees-to-ground theory, one of which is that there are no gliding animals today that flap for thrust.<br><br>The cursorial, or ground-up, theory of the origin of flight refers to the animal&#x2019;s ability to run. In this scenario, the first fliers were track stars with a yearning to take to the skies and soar. After zooming along the ground and making a series of leaps, to chase a dragonfly perhaps, or cross a creek, they somehow found themselves soaring with feathery forelimbs that had, perhaps through random mutations, grown large and light enough to keep them aloft. Left unexplained is where a heavy dinosaur would get the energy to run three times faster than modern birds in order to break the bonds of gravity and flap its way through the air, all with a developing wing. Perhaps, some have thought, they were half wings on a bipedal, or two-legged, creature, but why would an animal have a half wing if only a full wing would allow it to fly?<br><br>It&#x2019;s a good question, and one that&#x2019;s often asked when it comes to the evolution of flight. &#x201c;What good is half a wing?&#x201d; was first asked in 1871 by St. George Jackson Mivart, an English biologist. Mivart was at first devoted to Darwin&#x2019;s theory of natural selection&#x2014;the idea that as creatures evolved, only those who were most fit survived. He turned against his mentor, though, and later became one of the theory&#x2019;s most vehement critics&#x2014;largely over the bird wing. There is no reason on God&#x2019;s green earth for an animal to have half wings, because they are useless, he claimed. Ergo, the theory of evolution doesn&#x2019;t make sense; God must have created birds fully formed. To this day, creationists hold fast to the argument that half a bird wing refutes evolution.<br><br>This is where the first-flying-creature debate has stood for quite a while&#x2014;two main schools of thought arguing about their respective ideas, with a separate school believing that a bird&#x2019;s wing is a result of the act of divine creation, rather than meticulous and persistent shaping by eons of evolution.<br><br>A new perspective that combined aspects of both evolutionary theories arose when Ken Dial weighed in in the early 2000s. While his distinguished career has been about studying bird flight mechanics, he found that his approach could also be uniquely applied to the evolution of flight. &#x201c;Study the dinosaurs that made it&#x2014;the birds,&#x201d; he says. Understanding more about the evolution of flight by studying living animals provides a new perspective on the ecology and biology of birds and dinosaurs, information that can&#x2019;t be gotten elsewhere. &#x201c;These are things you would never get from studying fossils,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>With his shaved head, goatee, and glistening aviator sunglasses, the guitar-playing, jet-piloting Dial is perfect for the role of a renegade. He&#x2019;s a bird nut, as many people who investigate birds are, energetic and excited when talking about his research. The fact that he&#x2019;s an interloper on the subject, wading as a biologist into a field occupied largely by paleontologists, doesn&#x2019;t bother him. The origin-of-flight theorists base their respective arguments on the study of fossilized dinosaur bones. This necessarily involves a lot of conjecture because the beasts are so long gone, and their bodies are very unbirdlike at this point because they are fossils frozen in stone. Dial&#x2019;s work is based on videos of hundreds of live birds performing in his lab, doing things that no one knew birds did, as well as his study of their muscles, limbs, and other mechanics. I watched several of these films with Dial in his office at the Flight Laboratory in Missoula, part of the University of Montana, and I asked him how he thinks bird flight first took off. His is a fascinating idea, based, in part, he told me, on something called &#x201c;recapitulation theory,&#x201d; a theory that is largely rejected by science but that Dial has resurrected.<br><br>Recapitulation theory is a notion that goes back to ancient Egypt, though it was formalized in the nineteenth century by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel. It holds that the early development of a single animal mirrors the evolutionary history of the species. Very young human embryos look like fish, for example, as the theory poses that our human ancestors did long ago. Dial doesn&#x2019;t agree that this is true all of the time, but he believes it sometimes appears to be true.<br><br>Students in a graduate seminar he was teaching in the late 1990s, Dial tells me, helped set him on his path to investigate how flight may have first developed. As part of their assignment, they studied the origin of flight and interviewed published researchers in both the arboreal and cursorial schools. They concluded that there wasn&#x2019;t a lot of good data for either theory. So at the end of the seminar, the students issued Dial a challenge. Why didn&#x2019;t he, the functional morphologist, do some research and come up with a new take on this question of the origin of flight? Dial thought that was a fine idea, since the study of the subject is indeed &#x201c;very limited by the fact that the animal has been replaced by stone. It&#x2019;s not moving, just an anatomy left for us to try and interpret.&#x201d; The two theories, based on fossils and very little concrete evidence, &#x201c;constitute a lot of arm waving and little data,&#x201d; according to Dial. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to come up with a hypothesis with a simple dead structure you want to fit into your story. That&#x2019;s just storytelling. My feeling was that we need to understand broadly and in depth the anatomy and physiology of the living.&#x201d; Dial believed he could use his high-speed cameras and other sophisticated instrumentation to come up with some new ideas about the origin of flight.<br><br>Dial is well suited to take on the subject from a new angle. He&#x2019;s observed hundreds of species of wild birds for decades and taught field courses on birds across Africa. As a researcher, he has long and meticulously studied the physiology of birds, every component part, muscle, nerve, and bone, and how this equipment determines how birds fly and run. As the host of the acclaimed series All Bird TV on the Discovery Channel, he has also traveled across North and Central America, filming birds in the field and interviewing a wide range of other bird experts.<br><br>It was in an unlikely source that Dial found a glimpse into the likely origins of flight: baby birds, who, in those first few weeks of their existence, he believes, provide a detailed look at the millions of years it took for the ability to fly to evolve. It&#x2019;s just one example of how modern-day birds inform our knowledge about the very distant past.<br><br>It&#x2019;s hard to fathom the notion that the feathery little creatures that flock to our feeders are modern-day dinosaurs, but it&#x2019;s true. All birds are, though chickens and turkeys are genetically the closest dinosaur relatives. Researchers, in fact, have manipulated chicken genetics so chicks grow dinosaurlike beaks, feet, and legs. It took a scientific revolution to overthrow the notion that dinosaurs were reptiles, an idea that purportedly arose in 1868, when the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, so fierce an adherent to the idea of natural selection that he was known as Darwin&#x2019;s bulldog, was eating dinner one evening while thinking about a dinosaur bone he had earlier been working with in the lab. As he nibbled on the bottom of a turkey drumstick, he was struck by its similarity to the anklebone of the dinosaur.<br><br>There was also a peculiar fossil find in 1861 in Germany that fueled such thinking, the discovery of the archaeopteryx. About the size of a raven, the strange creature had broad wings and long feathers, and could fly, or at least glide, but actually had more in common with small dinosaurs than birds, including sharp teeth and a long bony tail. Archaeopteryx was a theropod&#x2014;Greek for &#x201c;beast feet&#x201d;&#x2014;a group that includes small to gigantic dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus rex, with feet similar to birds. Theropods had numerous other birdlike features: They brooded their eggs, had bones filled with air pockets to make them lighter, and in many cases had feathers and a wishbone, or furcula.<br><br>Birds and dinosaurs, Huxley thought, had to be related. It was a marked departure from the prevailing idea in the nineteenth century that birds were descended from a predinosaur reptile. It also implied that they had been warm-blooded, not cold. Huxley&#x2019;s idea got little traction, and the notion of a bird-dinosaur connection was largely forgotten. In the 1960s, though, Yale University&#x2019;s John Ostrom found twenty-two features in the skeletons of dinosaurs that were also found in birds, and he refloated the hypothesis. The &#x201c;dinosaur wars&#x201d; were under way, reaching a fever pitch in the 1980s as experts battled over whether dinosaurs were birdlike or reptilelike. By the 1990s, though, the matter was largely settled science.<br><br>Because they are related to dinosaurs, birds have been enlisted by scientists to tell us something about their ancestors. Dial turned to an unlikely subject&#x2014;a baby chukar partridge. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked in the lab with everything from pigeons and starlings, parakeets, magpies, finches, ducks, geese, and swans,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;but chukars fit the bill.&#x201d;<br><br>There are two forms in which birds are born into the world. One is altricial, which means &#x201c;requires nourishment.&#x201d; Altricial birds, such as the robin, are feeble, naked, and helpless after they burst through their eggshell, and they need days of doting care from parents who keep them warm and stuff food into their perpetually wide-open mouths as they develop feathers and the ability to fly. The other radically different way birds arrive is precocial, mind-bogglingly mature at birth, able to walk or run, evade predators, and forage for food on their own. Precocialism occurs along a spectrum and is especially pronounced in ground birds, who are most susceptible to predators. Some unusual birds, such as the megapodes&#x2014;&#x201c;large foot&#x201d;&#x2014;of Australia and New Zealand, are superprecocial, which means they are the most mature birds at birth of all. And Australian brush turkeys are the champions of superprecocial behavior.<br><br>Brush turkeys are bold, with no fear whatsoever of people. These days, they hang out in parks, near malls, and in other suburban settings. They look something like the wild turkeys found in North America&#x2014;a deep blue-black color, with a bright head and flat tail. They forage through leaves and grass on the forest floor for seeds, fruit, mice, frogs, and other small animals, and they build unusual giant communal nests out of leaves and twigs that can be as large as twelve feet wide and six feet tall. They are known as incubator birds, because when the hens lay their customary eighteen to twenty-four large white eggs, the heat from a compost pile they build beneath the nest radiates up to keep the eggs warm. The males tend the eggs carefully, sticking their beaks into the compost to monitor its temperature and adjusting the mix to make it warmer or cool it down.<br><br>As soon as the babies peck their way out of the shell they are ready to roll. At one day old&#x2014;one day!&#x2014;the fully feathered chick&#x2019;s eyes are wide open, and it literally hits the ground running. With extremely powerful legs and feet, these little chicks are able to fly and climb vertically up trees and rocks, abilities that allow them to evade snakes, dingoes, and other predators. &#x201c;The hatchlings are very comfortable on extraordinary slopes, with no panting or stress, doing it over and over again,&#x201d; says Dial. On that magical first day, a baby brush turkey can fly and run up steep and rocky cliffs better than an adult, though that ability eventually diminishes.<br><br>The chukar partridges that Dial studies are also precocial&#x2014;though not superprecocial&#x2014;ground birds. Chukar partridges are small and stocky, a member of the Galliform family, which also includes chickens and pheasants. They have a distinctive white face with a black gorget, or collar, of dark feathers. They favor dry, harsh terrain, and they eat a mixed diet, a buffet of insects, grass seed, roots, and whatever else they can scrounge. They were introduced to the United States from the deserts and mountains of their native Pakistan because they are fast and flap furiously when they take flight, which makes them an appealing quarry for bird hunters.<br><br>Chukars, like the pheasant and ostrich, lay their eggs in a depression in the ground. After a couple of weeks, the young hatch, and within twelve hours they run and start foraging for food, though they are still occasionally tended to by parents. There was something in the chukars, Dial thought, that was very dinosaur-like&#x2014;it was the way they used their four appendages, something he calls &#x201c;wing and leg cooperative use.&#x201d; They also maintained a wildness about them when he brought them into the lab. The Japanese quail he was using, on the other hand, which are commonly used as lab animals, were docile and sat quietly in his hand as he stroked them. Chukars could be raised and handled, yet they remained skittish and fled when he came near them&#x2014;a perfect combination of traits, he says, for studying how they learn to fly as a window into how the dinosaurs might first have learned to take to the air.</p><h2>Want More?

Harvard physician Joseph Glenmullen has led the charge to warn the public that antidepressants are overprescribed, underregulated, and, especially, misunderstood in their side and withdrawal effects. Now he offers a solution! <br> <br> More than twenty million Americans -- including over one million teens and children -- take one of today's popular antidepressants, such as Paxil, Zoloft, or Effexor. Dr. Glenmullen recognizes the many benefits of antidepressants and prescribes them to his patients, but he is also committed to warning the public of the dangers associated with overprescription. Dr. Glenmullen's last book, <i>Prozac Backlash,</i> sounded the alarm about possible dangers. <i>The Antidepressant Solution</i> provides the remedy. It is the first book to call attention to the drugs' catch-22: Although many people are ready to go off these drugs, they continue to take them because either the patient or the doctor mistakes antidepressant withdrawal for depressive relapse. <i>The Antidepressant Solution</i> offers an easy, step-by-step guide for patients and their doctors. <br> <br> Written by the premier authority in the field, <i>The Antidepressant Solution</i> is an invaluable book for all those concerned with going through the process -- from friends and family members to doctors and patients themselves.</p><p><b>Joseph Glenmullen, M.D.,</b> is a clinical instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, is on the staff of the Harvard University Health Services, and is in private practice in Harvard Square. A nationally recognized authority on antidepressant side effects, Dr. Glenmullen testified at the FDA hearing that resulted in the FDA's spring 2004 warning about the dangers of antidepressant use, especially suicidal tendencies. Dr. Glenmullen won the 2001 Annual Achievement Award from the American Academy for the Advancement of Medicine for his efforts in warning physicians about the potential dangers of antidepressants in his widely acclaimed book Prozac Backlash. Dr. Glenmullen lives with his wife and three children in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and can be found on the web at www.drglenmullen.com.<b> Preface </b> <p>As I wrote this book in 2004, doctors and the public experienced an upheaval in their view of the safety of today's popular antidepressants because the Food and Drug Administration issued a pair of warnings that have been startling to many: Antidepressants may make patients suicidal. In the initial March 2004 warning, the FDA asserted that "adult and pediatric patients" on antidepressants can develop a range of side effects that may make them suicidal, including "anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, impulsivity, akathisia (severe restlessness), hypomania, and mania." The FDA warned that patients may be vulnerable to this lethal side effect "especially at the beginning of therapy or when the dose either increases or decreases," that is, whenever the dose <i>changes.</i> Since decreasing the dose of an antidepressant may make patients suicidal, the warning is directly relevant to the subject of this book: how to taper off antidepressants safely and comfortably once one no longer needs them. In the second, October 2004 warning, the FDA upgraded the alert for children and adolescents to the strongest level possible: a prominent black box warning in the official information on the drugs. Said the FDA's director of the office of medical policy, Dr. Robert Temple: "I think we now all believe there is an increase in suicidal thinking and action that is consistent across all the drugs."</p> <p>The FDA warning is truly historic; it is the first time the agency has acknowledged that antidepressant drugs can make some patients suicidal. Until 2004, the FDA and pharmaceutical industry insisted that suicidality was more likely to be due to a patient's underlying psychiatric condition. Now the FDA has said unequivocally that antidepressant-induced suicidality "is beyond the suicidality as a result of the disease." The FDA warnings apply to all of today's popular antidepressants: Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, Lexapro, Effexor, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Remeron, Luvox, and Serzone. Indeed, the warnings apply to all thirty-two antidepressants currently on the market, including all of the older tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants. The complete list of antidepressants can be found in Table P.1. In light of the FDA warnings, patients and their doctors should not change the dose of antidepressants up or down without being well informed about how to do so safely and comfortably.</p> <p>The FDA is following the lead taken by its British counterpart, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the MHRA. In 2003, the British issued a series of warnings and virtually banned many antidepressants for children and adolescents under the age of eighteen. The British advised against the drugs because of the evidence in pharmaceutical company studies that the antidepressants are no more effective in children than placebo (dummy) pills but can make children agitated, sleepless, hostile, aggressive, and suicidal. While the British MHRA has virtually banned many antidepressants for some age groups, the FDA warnings have not banned any of the drugs.</p> <p>The American and British warnings have been accompanied by allegations that the pharmaceutical industry suppressed data on these lethal side effects for years. According to an article in the March 2004 issue of the <i>Canadian Medical Association Journal,</i> GlaxoSmithKline tested its drug Paxil on children and adolescents from 1993 to 1996. The article quotes a secret, internal GlaxoSmithKline report dating to October 1998 saying the studies showed Paxil "failed" to be more effective than placebo pills in depressed children. The secret memorandum urged company executives "to effectively manage the dissemination of these data in order to minimise any potential negative commercial impact" that might "undermine the profile" of Paxil. In other words, the position paper raised concerns that the damaging information might affect Paxil's global sales, which now approach $5 billion a year. How did the report propose to "effectively manage" the potentially damaging results? By selectively publishing the few "positive data" that would appear to make Paxil look good.</p> <p>To accomplish this goal, GlaxoSmithKline turned to the psychiatrists who conducted the studies for the company. Headed by Dr. Martin Keller, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the Brown University School of Medicine, a group of more than twenty leading academic psychiatrists published the selected Paxil data in the July 2001 issue of the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.</i> In stark contrast to the 1998 secret, internal GlaxoSmithKline memo, Keller and his colleagues used highly selected pieces of positive data to glowingly conclude in 2001: "Paxil is generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents."</p> <p>After the British and FDA warnings, in April 2004 the prestigious medical journal <i>The Lancet</i> published a damning critique of Keller's and a number of other similar antidepressant studies. In an accompanying editorial, <i>The Lancet</i> expressed outrage over the GlaxoSmithKline internal memo and misleading academic reports. <i>The Lancet</i> described the "selective reporting of favourable research" when side effects as serious as drug-induced suicide are at stake as a "catastrophe" that "should be unimaginable." <i>The Lancet</i> called the false reassurances of the pharmaceutical industry and the academic psychiatrists who work closely with the industry "an abuse of the trust patients place in their physicians." Calling the burgeoning antidepressant scandal "a disaster," <i>The Lancet</i> called for "legal powers" to force pharmaceutical companies to make unpublished data public. Indeed, a growing chorus of consumer advocates and professional organizations, including the American Medical Association, is calling for a public database that lists all pharmaceutical company data from unpublished as well as published studies.</p> <p>Keller's misleading 2001 report in the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i> was highly influential and widely used to promote prescribing antidepressants to children. Since then the use of the drugs for children has skyrocketed. But two years later, in June 2003, the British declared that the data showed Paxil is not effective for depressed children and, in fact, makes them suicidal and aggressive. Immediately following the British announcement, GlaxoSmithKline sent a "Dear Doctor" letter to physicians in England saying that Paxil should not be prescribed to children under eighteen years of age because it "failed" to work any better than placebo and frequently caused "hostility, agitation, [and] emotional lability (including crying, mood fluctuations, self-harm, suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide)." In June 2004, Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general for the State of New York, filed suit against GlaxoSmithKline charging the company with "fraud" for misrepresenting its studies of Paxil in children. The company ultimately settled the lawsuit and agreed to post both positive and negative drug research results on its website. Psychiatrists like Keller can each make millions of dollars consulting to pharmaceutical companies and have been criticized for "distorted and unbalanced" reporting of studies in "an attempt to show the drug in the most favourable light."</p> <p>In many instances, pharmaceutical companies ghostwrite the favorable drug studies published in academic journals. In some instances, the psychiatrists may allow companies to put their names on the reports without even seeing all the data. This practice, too, is increasingly coming under fire.</p> <p>The FDA has been heavily criticized for its handling of antidepressant-induced suicidality. In 2004, the FDA originally suppressed an analysis of the data on children taking antidepressants by their own internal reviewer, Dr. Andrew Mosholder, who concluded that the drugs made children suicidal, much as the British concluded. The Mosholder report was ultimately leaked to the media. In a controversial move, the FDA wasted valuable time and taxpayer dollars having researchers at Columbia University reanalyze the data. The researchers essentially came to the same conclusions Mosholder and the British had. Critics charge that the FDA's investigation of the antidepressant scandal is a conflict of interest since the agency's own reputation is at stake for having approved the drugs in the first place and having swept under the carpet repeated reports of their side effects, including antidepressant-induced suicidality, for over a decade. Critics also point to the revolving door of FDA officials in and out of working for pharmaceutical companies. As I finish writing this book, several congressmen have opened investigations into the FDA's mishandling of antidepressant side effects. The continuing revelations in the antidepressant scandal have shaken public confidence not only in the drugs but also in the drug companies, academic researchers, and even the FDA.</p> <p>What do doctors and patients do when patients are ready to go off the drugs if stopping antidepressants abruptly can cause severe withdrawal reactions that include suicidality, impulsivity, aggression, dizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, headaches, tremors, electric "zap" sensations in the brain, anxiety, crying spells, and insomnia? The problem is compounded by the fact that nowadays 70 percent of prescriptions for antidepressants are written by family doctors, many of whom do not know how to taper patients off the drugs. Family doctors are not responsible for the current situation; they have been pressured by HMOs and insurance companies to prescribe antidepressants rather than refer patients to specialists. In a study sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 72 percent of family doctors expressed frustration over the lack of access to quality mental health services for their patients. Many family doctors are not comfortable writing so many prescriptions for anti-depressants, but feel they have little choice i...</p></p><h2>Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse - Halloween Surprise Sound Book and Flashlight Set - PI Kids</h2><p><p>Boo!

More than ten years ago, he lay buried under a pile of burning bodies. The centuries&#x2013;old battle between Hutu and Tutsi tribes had come to Gilbert's school. Fueled by hatred, the Hutus forced more than a hundred Tutsi children and teachers into a small room and used machetes to beat most of them to death. The unfortunate ones who survived the beating were doused with gasoline and set on fire. After hiding under burning bodies for over eight hours, Gilbert heard a voice inside saying, "You will be all right; you will survive." He knows it was God speaking to him. Gilbert was the lone survivor of the genocide, and thanks his enduring faith in God for his survival. </p><p> Today, having forgiven his enemies and moved forward with his life, he is a world&#x2013;class athlete, running coach and celebrity in his new hometown of Austin, Texas. The road to this point has been a tough one, but Gilbert uses his survival instincts to spur him on to the goal of qualifying for the 2008 Olympic Summer Games. THIS VOICE IN MY HEART will portray not only the horrific event itself, but will be a catalyst for people to understand real forgiveness and the gift of faith in God.</p></p><p><p>Gilbert Tuhabonye is a graduate of Abilene Christian University and a world-class runner. He lives with his wife and two daughters in Austin, Texas, where he is an elite coach in the world of running.</p><br><br><p>Gary Brozek is a freelance writer and the author of more than 20 books, including 6 <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers. He lives in Colorado.</p>In this inspirational autobiography woven with a gruesome eyewitness account, Tuhabonye recounts his maturation as a world-class runner and his survival of a Burundi massacre. Born in 1974 to a minority ethnic Tutsi family, Tuhabonye grew up in rural Burundi, his intelligence and industry aided by spectacular athletic ability. The narrative alternates between the author's life story and events on the day of the massacres. In October 1993, after a Tutsi coup ousted the Hutu president, a Hutu mob invaded Tuhabonye's high school, hacked many Tutsi students to death with machetes and forced the rest into a building that they set afire. Only the author survived. After months of painful recovery from severe burns, he regained the ability to walk and then run again, a healing process facilitated by his faith&#x2014;a devout Christian, he says he forgave the murderers and praises God for sparing him. Tuhabonye joined Burundi's national team, traveled the world, fell in love and moved to the U.S., where he now lives with his wife and daughter&#x2014;an uplifting ending to a simply told story of a man who persevered through hard work, luck, presence of mind and (he emphasizes) God's love. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her powerful images--from migrant workers in California fleeing the "dustbowl," to struggling Southern sharecroppers-- became icons of the era. She later photographed Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II and traveled throughout Europe and Asia. This book presents 42 of the greatest images from throughout Lange's career, including some of her work done abroad. She possessed the ability, as she put it, to photograph "things as they are" and through this her photographs give us "more about the subjects than just the faces." It is no wonder that Edward Steichen called her the greatest documentary photographer in the United States. Linda Gordon contributes a new biographical essay and an image-by-image commentary to accompany a newly selected set of photographs. A professor of humanities and history at New York University, she has written at length on Dorothea Lange. Her 2009 book, "Dorothea Lange: A Life Beyond Limits," won the Bancroft Prize.<br>"Lange's work defines an era of destitution and drought, and still resonates even now.

Yet here he stood, literally up to his ankles in the blood of Christians. While alive, the four brothers had been exceptionally beautiful young men. But after their terrible deaths brought about by beatings and torture, they were unrecognizable masses of blood and flesh. The sight made him want to retch, but he could not appear to be weak before his citizens. </p><p>Pius was, for the most part, tolerant of the irksome minority who called themselves Christians. He even found it stimulating to participate in debates with those who were educated and reasonable. However odd he personally found their beliefs&#x2014;about the single messiah who rose from the dead and would come again&#x2014;their ideas did appear to be spreading at an unnervingly steady pace throughout Rome. A number of Roman nobles had converted to Christianity openly, and their participation in Christian rituals was tolerated by his government. This growing sect was also finding particular popularity with highborn females; women were included as equals in all its rites and ceremonies. They could even be priests in this strange new world of Christian thought and practice. </p><p>The Roman priests who held court in the temples of Jupiter and Saturn were up in arms that these Christians were allowed to offend the gods with their ridiculous concept of a single deity. Emperor Pius generally ignored the priests&#x2019; wailings, and thus life in Rome went on in relative peace during much of his reign. It was only when some aberration developed to endanger lives in the Roman republic, some tragedy or natural disaster, that the Christians found themselves mortally threatened. The Roman priests, and their followers, were quick to blame the Christians for any and all misfortunes that might befall Rome. Surely it was their monotheistic insult to the true gods of the republic that caused divine retribution to fall on the other innocent and obedient citizens? </p><p>Emperor Pius had himself discovered in his debates that there were two types of Christians: the wild-eyed fanatics who often seemed anxious to die to prove their great piety, and the truly reasonable and compassionate adherents who were more devoted to helping the poor and healing the sick than they were to preaching and converting. Pius definitely preferred the latter type; they were making a positive contribution to their communities and were valuable citizens. These Christians, whom he called the Compassionates, were fond of telling stories of their messiah and his great healing ability and of quoting his very wise words about the need for charity. Most often, they spoke passionately about the power of love and its many forms. Indeed there were even some Christians here in Rome who claimed direct descent from their messiah himself, through his children who had settled in Europe. These claimants were the same Compassionates who worked tirelessly to help the suffering and the poor. Their undisputed leader was a stunning and charismatic noblewoman called Lady Petronella. The flame-haired Petronella was beloved by the people of Rome, despite her openly Christian practices, as she was the daughter and heiress of one of Rome&#x2019;s oldest families. She used her wealth generously for the highest good of the republic and preached only of the need for love and tolerance. If Petronella and her Compassionates, had been the only kind of Christian in Rome, this onslaught of terrible bloodshed would likely never have begun. </p><p>But the group of Christians that Pius referred to as the Fanatics were another story altogether. In contrast to the Compassionates, who spoke of their messiah in warm and devoted tones as the great teacher of a spiritual path they called the Way of Love, the Fanatics screeched of the one true God who would eliminate all others and bring about a reign of terror for the unbelievers at a time of final judgment. The Romans were deeply offended by this perspective, and the Fanatics compounded <br>the offense by insisting that life on earth did not matter and that only the afterlife was of importance. Such a philosophy, such a craven disregard for the gift of life that the gods bestowed upon mortals, was absolute sacrilege to the Roman priests and their followers. It was incomprehensible to a culture of people who celebrated the experience of the physical senses in their countless spiritual and civic festivals. To most Romans, the Fanatics were an enigma born out of madness, a group to be shunned if not feared. </p><p>Thus it was the Fanatics who raised the ire of the Roman people, even when there were no natural disasters to contend with. But when <br>a deadly influenza outbreak struck an affluent Roman suburb, the priests of Saturn began to cry for the blood of Christians to appease their god. </p><p>In the center of this growing drama was a wealthy Roman widow, the Lady Felicita. Felicita had converted to Christianity when, overcome by grief following the sudden death of her noble and beloved husband, she had turned her back on the Roman gods. It was said that, left alone to raise seven sons without a father, she went mad with the anguish of her loss. Felicita was visited by Christians who offered her comfort in her mourning, and she ultimately found strength and so-<br>lace in the Fanatics&#x2019; extreme perspective on the absolute importance of the afterlife. In this ideal, Felicita was consoled that her husband was in a better place where she would join him one day, and they would be together with their children as a family in heaven. </p><p>While Felicita burned with the passion of the newly converted, most of the nobles in her community were not overly upset by her behavior. Felicita would spend hours each day on her knees in prayer, but most felt that this was her own business. In addition, Felicita was charitable and generous, donating portions of her dead husband&#x2019;s fortune to the building of a hospital and compelling her older sons to contribute physical labor to help the infirm. As a result, Felicita&#x2019;s strong and beautiful children were very popular with the people of the Roman suburb in which they dwelled. The boys ranged in age from the golden-haired youngest, called Martial, who was in his seventh summer, to the tall and athletic eldest, Januarius, who was twenty years on earth. </p><p>The world in which Felicita and her sons lived remained relatively peaceful until the influenza swept into their town. It struck intermittently and at random, but those who were afflicted by it rarely survived the extreme fevers that accompanied the retching and convulsions. When the firstborn son of a Saturnian priest succumbed to the illness, the distraught man rallied the population to join him in accusing Felicita and her sons of bringing down the wrath of the gods upon them. Clearly, Saturn had punished his own priest to make his point clear: the Romans would need to be strong in their opposition to these Christian people who dared to regard their true gods as obsolete. The gods would not stand for it, and certainly not a god such as Saturn, who was the domineering and ruthless patriarch of the Roman pantheon. Hadn&#x2019;t Saturn even devoured his own son when he found him to be disobedient? </p><p>Felicita and all seven of her children were subsequently brought before the regional magistrate, Publius. Because of Felicita&#x2019;s noble status, they were not shackled by chains or tied but were allowed to enter the court of their own volition. Felicita was a handsome woman, tall and well built, with flowing dark hair and the walk of a queen. She stood straight and proud before the court, never wavering and showing no fear. </p><p>The proceedings began calmly and were carried out with due order. While Magistrate Publius was known to have a harsh streak when provoked, he was not as monstrous as some of the local jurists were known to be. He read out the charges against Felicita and her sons in measured tones. </p><p>&#x201c;Lady Felicita, you and your children have been brought to this court today under suspicion. The citizens of Rome have grave concerns that you have angered our gods, most specifically, that you have offended Saturn, the great father of the gods. Saturn has taken vengeance upon your community, claiming the lives of a number of your neighbors, including innocent children, as a result. The laws of our people state that &#x2018;refusal to accept the gods angers the gods and disrupts the forces of the universe. When the gods have been angered, those culprits who have caused their consternation must beg forgiveness by making sacrifices to them.&#x2019; Therefore you and your children are commanded to worship in the Temple of Saturn for eight days, making appropriate sacrifices as designated by the priests until the god has been appeased. Do you accept this as a fair and just sentence?&#x201d; </p><p>Felicita stood mute before the court, her children standing in a line behind her, equally silent. </p><p>Publius repeated the question, adding, &#x201c;You do understand that the alternative is death? Failure to appease the gods puts our entire nation at risk. Thus you will perform your sacrifices or you will die. The choice is yours.&#x201d; </p><p>Publius&#x2019; exasperation grew as Felicita made him wait for what seemed an interminable amount of time. When it became clear that she did not have any intention of speaking, the magistrate eventually snapped. &#x201c;You offend the authority of this court and the people of Rome with your silence. I demand your answer, or it will be beaten from you.&#x201d; </p><p>Felicita raised her head to look directly at Publius. When she finally replied, it was with the fire of conviction in her eyes and in her words. </p><p>&#x201c;Do not threaten me, heathen. The spirit of the One God is with me and will overcome every assault you make upon me and my family, as he can take us to a place where you will never go. I will not enter a pagan temple nor make sacrifices to your powerless gods. Nor will my childr...</p></p><h2>SuperPuppy Goes to Puppy Class: How to Train the Best Dog You&#39;ll Ever Have!</h2><p>Continue to build on the great start your dog got from SuperPuppy: How to Raise the Best Dog You&#39;ll Ever Have!

He received the Dog Writers' Association of America writing award for a series of articles on raising dogs that appeared in Veterinary Medicine/Small Animal Clinician. The book, SuperPuppy: How to Raise the Best Dog You'll Ever Have! developed from that series of articles. <p>Peter currently lives in the San Diego area with his wife, Nancy and their dogs, Blackfoot, Sage and Pinto. They compete in agility and herding trials.</p>"When can I take my puppy to training class?" <p>This is often one of the first questions asked by new pet owners, and is also the topic of considerable debate among dog handling experts. </p><p>With the aid of choke collars, traditional obedience classes stress on-leash lessons in HEEL, COME, SIT, DOWN and STAY. They only accept dogs six months or older and usually tailor their training towards future obedience competition. Unfortunately, not all that much emphasis is placed upon day-to-day, pet-owner concerns. </p><p>Other classes take a more lenient approach and accept pups as young as eight weeks. These "kindergarten" classes use food lures, enticing the puppies to perform for a tasty treat. Much of the time is spent playing and socializing with the other dogs and their owners. </p><p>The SuperPuppy goal is to raise a dog that grows up to be a contributing member of the family - one that behaves not because it was forced or "bribed" to, but because it wants to! In the SuperPuppy approach, dogs are not seen as robots that can be readily programmed using force or food, but as infinitely complicated beings capable of solving a vast range of problems! </p><p>So, when can you start training your puppy? As soon as you're ready!

Offering wonderful perspectives on dozens of unique (and likely never-to-be-seen-again) baseball personalities, <i>Seasons in Hell</i> recounts some of the most extreme characters ever to play the game and brings to life the no-holds-barred culture of major league baseball in the mid-seventies</p><p>Mike Shropshire is a longtime journalist who has written for numerous newspapers and magazines such as <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and is the author of several books, including <i>When the Tuna Went down to Texas: How Bill Parcells Led the Cowboys Back to the Promised Land</i>. He lives in Dallas, Texas.A tiresome ``gonzo'' journalism account of mid-1970s life on the road with a big league ballclub. As a 30-ish beat writer for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Shropshire drew the unenviable task of covering the Texas Rangers, a sad-sack team recently relocated from Washington, D.C. (where they were a 1961 expansion descendant of the original Senators team that became the Minnesota Twins--a fact misstated by the author). In a bit of characteristic overstatement, Shropshire comments that the ``Texas Rangers were not really a franchise but rather like a Kurt Vonnegut novel.'' And during his stint with the club, the author witnessed (admittedly through a haze of booze and prescription painkillers) some of the game's most absurd goings-on, some of which actually occurred on the field. While the Rangers were not a quality attraction, Shropshire probably should have spent more time reporting on the team's play (which, at least during 1974, wasn't all that bad--they did challenge the powerful Oakland A's for the American League West title) rather than take his regular discursive excursions into the seamy north Texas baseball demimonde of whores, booze, and fistfights--or, even worse, describe his frequent hangovers (``My head was like a gelatinous, blimp-sized container of nerve endings''). Still, for all this noodling, Shropshire does manage some dead-on character sketches, notably of 18-year-old phenom David Clyde, a number-one draft pick who, as a result of being prodded into service too soon in his career in order to fill seats at the Rangers' cavernous and cadaverous ballpark, turned out to be one of the game's biggest busts; Billy Martin, the mercurial, self-destructive manager of the '74 and '75 clubs; ``Strange Ranger'' Willie Davis; and other players, coaches, fans, and sportswriters. This book is unfortunately hamstrung by its author's tortured delivery. It's the literary equivalent of a knuckleball; good on occasions but difficult to handle.

It came without warning, in the middle of a playoff game, with millions of people watching. And it has never gone away.<br>Yet the true test of Ankiel's character came not on the mound, but in the long days and nights that followed as he searched for a way to get back in the game.

The women drop their chores to view the destruction of the trees that provide so many necessities-wood for cooking and building, shelter for animals, fruits and berries to eat. Kalawati, a village elder, tries to stop them, but is rudely ignored by these men who have official, written orders to proceed. But when Aani's favorite tree is threatened, she sets a bold example of passive resistance by hugging it. Atkins has developed a highly sympathetic character in Aani, as well as a clear picture of life in a rural Indian community.

He lives in Los Angeles.Dancing with Myself<br><br><b>PROLOGUE</b><br><br> &nbsp;<br><b>THEY SAY IF YOU HEAR THE </b><b>BANG, YOU&#x2019;RE STILL ALIVE</b><br> &nbsp;<br> By the morning of February 6, 1990, I&#x2019;d been living on a fine edge for more than a decade, always courting disaster to experience the biggest high. I&#x2019;d been living the deranged life. I felt so nihilistic, yet why hadn&#x2019;t I just tuned in and dropped out? Instead, I followed Jim Morrison&#x2019;s credo, the credo of Coleridge and, at one point, Wordsworth, the credo of self-discovery through self-destruction I so willfully subscribed to until this moment:<br><br><i>Live every day as if it&#x2019;s your last, and one day you&#x2019;re sure to be right</i>.<br><br> On this fateful morning, I&#x2019;m standing wide-awake at dawn in the living room of my house in Hollywood Hills, overlooking the Los Angeles basin that falls and stretches away toward the high-rising pillars of downtown. I haven&#x2019;t slept, still buzzing from the night&#x2019;s booze and illicit substances lingering in my bloodstream, staring at the view of the city beginning its early morning grumblings. Daylight unfolds and casts shadows within the elevation, as if God is slowly revealing his colors for the day from his paint box, the hues of brown and green of earth and foliage offset by the bleached white of the protruding rocks that hold my home in place on the hillside.<br><br> Standing at my window, I hear sirens blaring in the distance. <i>Some</i><i>one wasn&#x2019;t so lucky</i>, I think as I tune in to the rumble of cars ferrying tired and impatient commuters on the 101 freeway that winds through the Cahuenga Pass, the sound of a world slowly getting back in motion. The constant moan of the freeway echoes that of my tired and played-out soul.<br><br> Just the night before, after almost two years of work, we put the aptly titled album <i>Charmed Life </i>to bed. I&#x2019;m feeling some pressure, home early from the de rigueur studio party. I say that as if we threw one party to celebrate the completion of the album, but the truth is that the party went on for two years. Two years of never-ending booze, broads, and bikes, plus a steady diet of pot, cocaine, ecstasy, smack, opium, quaaludes, and reds. I passed out in so many clubs and woke up in the hospital so many times; there were incidents of returning to consciousness to find I was lying on my back, looking at some uniformly drab, gray hospital ceiling, cursing myself and thinking that I was next in line to die outside an L.A. nightclub or on some cold stone floor, surrounded by strangers and paparazzi.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve been taking GHB, a steroid, to help relieve symptoms of the fatigue that has been plaguing me and preventing me from working out and keeping my body in some semblance of good shape. If you take too much GHB, which I&#x2019;m prone to do, it&#x2019;s like putting yourself in a temporary coma for three hours; to observers, it appears as if you are gone from this world.<br><br> When we began recording in 1988, we promised each other we&#x2019;d be cool and focused, and not wholly indulge in drugs and debauchery. But as weeks stretched into months, Fridays often finished early with &#x201c;drop-time&#x201d;&#x2014;the moment we all took ecstasy. And then Friday soon became Thursday and so on, until all rules were taboo. We somehow managed to make music through the constant haze. It seemed like every few days I was recovering from yet another wild binge, and it took three days to feel &#x201c;normal&#x201d; again. The album proved to be slow going and the only way to feel any kind of relief from the pressure was to get blotto, avoid all human feelings, and reach back into the darkness once again. Somewhere in that darkness, I told myself, there was a secret of the universe or some hidden creative message to be found.<br> &nbsp;<br> We&#x2019;d invite girls to come to the studio to listen to the music. Mixing business with pleasure seemed the best way to see if the new songs worked. We&#x2019;d be snorting lines of cocaine, and then the girls would start dancing. Before long, they&#x2019;d end up having sex with one or more of us on the studio floor. Once the party was in full swing, we walked around naked but for our biker boots and scarves. Boots and Scarves became the running theme.<br><br> The girls loved it and got in on the act. It helped that we recruited them at the local strip bars; they felt comfortable naked. We had full-on orgies in those studios we inhabited for months. It was like a glorified sex club. We were all about instant gratification, lords of the fix.<br><br> I&#x2019;d like to think this was all in the name of song-searching: the sex and drugs amped up the music, the songs arriving in the midst of chaos, cigarettes stubbed out into plates of food, the bathroom floor covered with vomit, sweaty sex going on all over the studio as we tried out our guitar riffs and mixes. The sound of our mixes, turned up loud, drowned out the background noise of sucking &nbsp;and &nbsp;fucking. &nbsp;Songs must be written. The ideas must flow. The flow must go to one&#x2019;s most base desires. Without constraint.<br><br> Now that it&#x2019;s all said and done, I feel exhausted and shattered. The keyed-up feeling that prevents me from sleeping is the result of the care and concern I put into making a record that will decide the course of my future. That&#x2019;s the sort of pressure I put on myself every time. Then there&#x2019;s the fact that the production costs have been astronomical; the need to keep the bandwagon rolling has drained my spirit and sapped my will.<br><br> Months later, <i>Charmed Life </i>will go on to sell more than a million copies. The &#x201c;Cradle of Love&#x201d; single and video, directed by David Fincher, will both become massive hits. But I don&#x2019;t know this when I retreat to my home alone at &nbsp;2 &nbsp;a.m., &nbsp;intending &nbsp;to &nbsp;get &nbsp;some &nbsp;rest after wrapping recording. The breakup of my relationship with my girlfriend, Perri, the mother of my son, Willem, has left me bereft, but finishing the album has been my only priority. &#x201c;If the thing is pressed . . . Lee will surrender,&#x201d; Lincoln telegraphed Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox in 1865. And then: &#x201c;Let the thing be pressed.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll attitude. The difficult has to be faced straight-on and the result forged out of sweat and tears. That&#x2019;s where I take my inspiration.<br> &nbsp;<br> The wide-screen version of the last few years&#x2019; tumultuous events plays in my subconscious and cannot be ignored. What can I do to keep away these blues that rack my thoughts and creep into my bones? It&#x2019;s a fine day, warming up, the sun burning off the morning smog. Still, I feel uneasy, dissatisfied in the pit of my stomach. With the album now finished, I&#x2019;ll have to take stock of life and contemplate the emptiness without Perri and Willem.<br><br><i>The bike will blow away these post-album blues</i>, I think. As I open the garage door, the chrome of my 1984 Harley-Davidson Wide Glide gleams with expectation, beckoning me.<br><br> The L.A. traffic is thick and the warmth of the sun is fresh on my face, its glow spreading over my bare head. California has yet to pass legislation making the wearing of helmets compulsory, and I&#x2019;ve always liked the feel of the wind in my hair. My bike clears its throat with a deep, purring growl. The gleaming black tank and chrome fixtures flash in the sharp, sacrosanct daylight. I&#x2019;ve opted for all denim to match the blue-sky high.</p><h2>National Geographic Readers: Planets</h2><p>This brilliantly illustrated book taps into children's natural curiosity about the vast world of space.

But even among the&nbsp;most powerful&nbsp;firms, Lazard Fr�res &amp; Co. stood apart. Discretion, secrecy, and&nbsp;subtle strategy were its weapons of choice. For&nbsp;more than a century, the mystique and reputation of the "Great Men" who worked there allowed the firm to garner unimaginable profits, social cachet, and outsized influence in the halls of power. But in the mid-1980s, their titanic egos started getting in the way, and the Great Men of Lazard jeopardized all they had built.<br><br>William D. Cohan, himself a former high-level Wall Street banker, takes the reader into the mysterious and secretive world of Lazard and&nbsp;presents a&nbsp;compelling portrait&nbsp;of Wall Street through the&nbsp;tumultuous history&nbsp;of this exalted and fascinating company.&nbsp; Cohan deconstructs the explosive feuds between Felix Rohatyn and Steve Rattner, superstar investment bankers and pillars of New York society, and between the man who controlled Lazard, the inscrutable French billionaire Michel David-Weill, and his chosen successor, Bruce Wasserstein.<br><br>Cohan follows Felix, the consummate adviser, as he reshapes corporate America in the 1970s and 1980s, saves New York City from bankruptcy, and positions himself in New York society and in Washington. Felix&#x2019;s dreams are dashed after the arrival of Steve, a formidable and ambitious former<i> </i>newspaper reporter.&nbsp;By the mid-1990s, as Lazard neared its 150th anniversary, Steve and Felix were feuding openly.<br>&nbsp;<br>The internal strife caused by their arguments could not be solved by the imperious Michel, whose manipulative tendencies served only to exacerbate the trouble within the firm. Increasingly desperate, Michel took the unprecedented step of relinquishing operational control of Lazard to one of the few Great Men still around, Bruce Wasserstein, then fresh from selling his own M&amp;A boutique, for $1.4 billion.&nbsp; Bruce&#x2019;s take: more than $600 million.&nbsp;But it turned out Great Man Bruce had snookered Great Man Michel when the Frenchman was at his most vulnerable.&nbsp; <br><br><i>The LastTycoons</i> is a tale of vaulting ambitions, whispered advice, worldly mistresses, fabulous art collections, and enormous wealth&#x2014;a story of high drama in the world of high finance.&nbsp;</p><p>William D. Cohan was an award-winning investigative journalist before embarking on a seventeen-year career as an investment banker on Wall Street. He spent six years at Lazard Fr�res in New York and later became a Managing Director at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. He is a graduate of Duke University and received both an MS from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and an MBA from its Graduate School of Business. He lives in New York City and Columbia County, New York.CHAPTER 1<br>&#x201c;GREAT MEN&#x201d;<br>Even among the great Wall Street firms&#x2014;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch&#x2014;Lazard Fr�res &amp; Co. stood apart, explicitly priding itself on being different from, and superior to, its competitors. For 157 years, Lazard had punched above its weight. Unlike other Wall Street banks, it competed with intellectual rather than financial capital and through a hard-won tradition of privacy and independence. Its strategy, put simply, was to offer clients the wisdom of its Great Men, the finest and most experienced collection of investment bankers the world had ever known. They risked no capital, offering only the raw Darwinian power of their ideas. The better the idea, and the insights and tactics required to achieve the result contemplated by it, the greater was Lazard's currency as a valued and trusted adviser&#x2014;and the larger were the piles of money the Great Men hauled out of the firm and into their swelling bank accounts. The lucky few men&#x2014;yes, always men&#x2014;at Wall Street&#x2019;s summit have always been portrayed as ambitious and brilliant on the one hand and unscrupulous and ruthless on the other. But the secret history of Lazard Fr�res &amp; Co., the world&#x2019;s most elite and enigmatic investment bank, twists parts of this conventional wisdom into knots of unfathomable complexity. The Great Men chronicled herein amassed huge fortunes&#x2014;to be sure&#x2014;but they refused to admit to anyone, least of all to themselves, that their pursuit of these riches led to relentless infighting. Instead they spoke, without irony, of being part of a Florentine guild and of advice whispered to heads of state and to CEOs of the world's most powerful corporations, while all the time attempting to preserve the mythical <i>special idea</i> that was Lazard. They also, to a person, craved an equally elusive chimera: the assurance that somehow, despite everything, they alone had remained <i>virtuous</i>.<br><br>But starting in the mid-1980s, the wisdom of Lazard&#x2019;s Great Men strategy began to show its considerable age, especially when Lazard was compared with its better capitalized and more powerful and nimble foes. The firm&#x2019;s numerous strategic missteps were exacerbated by the increasingly titanic generational struggle inside Lazard between the likes of Felix Rohatyn and Steve Rattner&#x2014;superstar investment bankers and pillars of New York society&#x2014;as well as by the bizarre behavior of the increasingly isolated and bitter Michel David&#x2013;Weill, the French billionaire who controlled Lazard and fomented the struggle from his imperial lair. And at the climactic moment, Bruce Wasserstein, the supreme opportunist, came along to pick Michel&#x2019;s considerable pockets. The decades of internal turmoil and paternalistic management led ultimately to the once&#x2013;unthinkable: a Lazard Fr�res free from its founders, as a publicly traded company just like any other, its operational flaws and obscene profitability open to the world&#x2014;its special cachet lost forever.<br><br>The story of Lazard has always been one of internecine warfare, calamity, and resurrection, proving definitively that the forces of &#x201c;creative destruction&#x201d;&#x2014;in the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter&#x2019;s famous observation&#x2014;are alive and well to this day in American capitalism.<br>***<br><br>Of all Lazard&#x2019;s Great Men, none was greater than Felix George Rohatyn. Felix was considered by many to be the world's preeminent investment banker. He was the man who saved, first, Wall Street and then New York City from financial ruin in the early 1970s. For some thirty years at the end of the twentieth century, he had unofficially presided over Lazard Fr�res, helping to transform it into Wall Street&#x2019;s most prestigious, enigmatic, and mysterious investment banking partnership. But on one of those impossibly close days in our nation&#x2019;s capital, in the summer of 1997, Rohatyn found himself at the end of his tenure at Lazard, testifying before a Senate subcommittee in hopes of obtaining ratification of his appointment to a position he had long maintained was beneath him.<br><br>&#x201c;It is a great honor for me to appear before you today to seek your consent to President Clinton&#x2019;s nomination of me to serve as the next American Ambassador to France,&#x201d; the sixty&#x2013;nine&#x2013;year&#x2013;old Felix told the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. &#x201c;It is also a very emotional experience, for many reasons...I am, as you know, a refugee who came to this country from Nazi&#x2013;occupied Europe in 1942. As long as I can remember, going back to those very dark days, being an American was my dream. I was fortunate to achieve that dream, and America has more than fulfilled all of my expectations. To represent, at this time, my adopted country as her Ambassador would be the culmination of my career; to have been nominated to represent my country in France, a country where I spent part of my childhood and with which I have had a lifelong relationship, both professional and personal, seems to me more than I could ever have hoped for.&#x201d;<br><br>In truth, the thick&#x2013;browed, beaver&#x2013;toothed Felix had for more than twenty years campaigned relentlessly for more, much more. With absolute clarity of mind, he knew he deserved better than an ambassadorship, a position he once likened to that of butler. Felix was <i>the</i> Great Man of Lazard, Le Corbusier of the most important mergers and acquisitions, or M&amp;A, deals of the second half of the twentieth century, the ultimate rainmaker and corporate confidant, who year after year single&#x2013;handedly generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for himself and his partners, thereby controlling his colleagues through a delicious combination of fear and greed.<br><br>After all, who could possibly afford to disobey a man who put so much money into his partners&#x2019; pockets while taking far less than he was entitled to? When Felix called or wandered through Lazard&#x2019;s spartan offices in One Rockefeller Center, his partners snapped to attention, dropped whatever they might be doing, and acceded to his every wish. As his deal&#x2013;making prowess continued unabated over the years, he had somehow also found the energy to volunteer his precious time and incomparable insights to solve two of this country&#x2019;s major financial crises of the second half of the twentieth century.<br><br>First, in the early 1970s, he worked round the clock to cobble together solutions that stanched the bleeding caused by the &#x201c;back&#x2013;office crisis&#x201d; afflicting many of the largest old&#x2013;line Wall Street brokerages. Through a series of nail&#x2013;biting and courageously conceived mergers, Felix prevented the meltdown of a large part of the securities industry. Second, he is credited with almost single&#x2013;handedly devising the financial rescue package that saved New York City from bankruptcy in 1975, standing tall against President Gerald Ford and his incendiary refusal to help. With these matters resolved satisfactorily, Felix became Hamlet, the lone voice, <i>the</i> Democrat in exile during the fallow years of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, exhorting the party faithful to action through his regular dispatches in the tony pages of the <i>New York Review of Books</i>, creating what became nothing less than the Rohatyn Manifesto. He courted the great intellectuals and leaders of the day in his genteel salon on Fifth Avenue and at his annual Easter egg hunts at his Southampton manse. He was the epitome of the Great Man.<br><br>By the time of Bill Clinton&#x2019;s election in 1992, he not only wanted desperately to be secretary of the Treasury but believed he had earned it. Maybe he even was owed it. Indeed, some believe he had wanted the post as early as the Carter administration. Had Jimmy Carter been able to win another presidential election and had Felix been less critical of Carter in his writings, speeches, and interviews, he might have had a shot. But in 1980, Carter lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan. So Felix had waited stoically through the two Reagan terms and that of the first Bush for the return of a Democrat to the White House. His moment had finally arrived, along with Clinton&#x2019;s, in November 1992. Felix vigorously lobbied for the Treasury secretary post, through the clandestine channels that exist for such genteel advocacy and by manipulating the levers he had pulled for years with the dexterity of a maestro: his legendary orchestration of the notoriously fickle troika of corporate chieftains, New York society, and the press was the envy of every investment banker and corporate lawyer on the planet.<br><br>And yet Felix&#x2019;s considerable efforts had fallen short, for reasons that begin to reveal the many nuances and contradictions of one of America&#x2019;s most powerful&#x2014;and least scrutinized&#x2014;men. When Clinton came to see Felix in his diminutive, picture&#x2013;lined Lazard office during the election season of 1992, the Napoleonic Rohatyn received him coolly and enigmatically, having for some reason failed to fully perceive the Clinton juggernaut. He chose instead to lend his considerable prestige to the third&#x2013;party candidate H. Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and founder of EDS Corporation, who was his former client.<br><br>Felix had first met Perot in the early 1970s at the urging of John Mitchell, Richard Nixon&#x2019;s first attorney general. Mitchell thought Perot would be helpful to Felix in solving the New York Stock Exchange crisis. Felix then brokered a deal whereby Perot invested what turned out to be close to $100 million in DuPont Glore, a failing old&#x2013;line brokerage. Perot&#x2019;s investment at the time represented the largest amount of money ever invested by a single individual in a Wall Street firm. DuPont Glore failed anyway, and Perot lost his investment. Yet his friendship with Felix blossomed. Felix served on EDS&#x2019;s board of directors and advised Perot on the sale of EDS to General Motors. He rewarded Perot&#x2019;s loyalty by supporting him through much of the 1992 presidential campaign&#x2014;a point Felix tries to parse today, in hindsight. But Perot&#x2019;s presidential aspirations were predictably unsuccessful, as were, not surprisingly, Felix&#x2019;s own to become secretary of the Treasury after Clinton&#x2019;s election.<br><br>Even though many important and influential people believed Felix to be immensely deserving, through a combination of hubris, bad luck, and political miscalculation he didn't get the prize. Clinton turned first to Senator Lloyd Bentsen and then to Robert Rubin, the former co-CEO of Goldman Sachs&#x2014;a man twenty years Rohatyn&#x2019;s junior with nary a trace of his civic accomplishments or reputation. But Rubin had been doing something that Felix had not been willing to do, that Felix had felt uncomfortable doing: Rubin had raised millions of dollars for Clinton and for the Democratic Party. There are rewards for that kind of thing.<br><br>In his memoir, <i>In an Uncertain World</i>, Rubin makes no mention of perceiving any competition with Felix for the Treasury job. But he does recount, with some frustration, Felix&#x2019;s Great Man status and his preeminence as a banker. Rubin had hurt his back just prior to a board of directors meeting for one of his clients, Studebaker&#x2013;Worthington, at which Rubin and Goldman were to play the dual role of board members and investment bankers. Rubin recounted how he attended the Saturday board meeting, at the request of the CEO, Derald Ruttenberg, lying flat on his back, as the board met to consider whether to sell the company.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought,&#x201d; Rubin recalled, &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t go, he&#x2019;ll hire Felix Rohatyn&#x2014;the renowned investment banker from Lazard whom Ruttenberg had also mentioned. I couldn&#x2019;t walk for more than a few yards at the time, or even sit, but I went to Ruttenberg&#x2019;s office and lay on his window seat. We got the business, though much to my dismay, Ruttenberg gave Felix part of the fee. (It&#x2019;s more than twenty&#x2013;five years later, but I still remember the amount.) Ruttenberg said he wanted Felix to be satisfied, given his importance in the world.&#x201d;<br><br><i>His importance in the world</i>. Rubin, as capable of flattery as the next monumentally successful investment banker, was simply and matter&#x2013;of&#x2013;factly acknowledging Felix&#x2019;s canonical position among the power elite of merger advisers, a rare breed of peacock the brightness of whose plumage had been known to fade from year to year.<br><br>Regardless of the decade, Felix has been a constant atop the leaderboard of M&amp;A advisers. Even today, at seventy&#x2013;eight, his diplomatic career complete, he still advises powerful CEOs on their most important deals and receives millions of dollars in fees for his work.<br><br>At Lazard, Felix had come to personify the firm&#x2019;s unique&#x2014;and uniquely successful&#x2014;business strategy of employing the smartest and most experienced investment bankers to offer ambitious corporate CEOs sagacious insight on how to do deals, and nothing more. No loans. No underwriting of debt or equity (or barely any). No published research. No questionable off&#x2013;balance&#x2013;sheet financing &#x201c;vehicles.&#x201d; Only Great Men offering advice to the world's business leaders. There was a good deal of myth to this legend, of course, since as with any large group of people, the 80&#x2013;20 rule applied to Lazard as well&#x2014;with Felix among the 20 percent of the partners who produced 80 percent of the revenues.<br><br>But unlike his mentor, the tyrannical and legendary Andr� Meyer, Felix found offering advice to clients exhilarating&#x2014;and he was bored by management responsibilities. He often described Lazard as simply &#x201c;a group of important people, giving important people advice.&#x201d; Felix was proud to be solely an adviser whose wisdom was sought out internationally for cogent, insightful advice on mergers and acquisitions: nothing more, nothing less&#x2014;and not a trace of apology for not being the top underwriter of junk bonds (a product he railed against) or equity offerings. No frustration with not being a private&#x2013;equity investor. <i>The Big Boys</i>, a 1986 book by Ralph Nader and William Taylor, referred to Felix as &#x201c;the interstitial man,&#x201d; someone who gets in the middle of things. Raymond Troubh, a former Lazard partner, was one of many people quoted by Nader and Taylor about Felix.<br><br>&#x201c;Felix is enveloping the world,&#x201d; Troubh confided. &#x201c;He is sort of the Henry Kissinger of the financial arena. He is stepping into politics as Kissinger is stepping into finance...But I don&#x2019;t think his [public role] was a calculated decision. He never said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m going to be prominent on the public scene.&#x2019; He wanted to be a great investment banker. That brought him into the eyes of the kingmakers in different arenas, in New York and Washington, and from then on his ability pushed him...I equate him with Kissinger, who I think is an outstanding example of a combination of brilliance, power and will to win. I put Felix in the same basket, exactly the same basket.&#x201d; In his own interviews with Nader, Felix deflected the Kissinger comparison in a way that betrayed his hidden insecurities. &#x201c;Oh, because we are foreign born,&#x201d; Felix allowed. &#x201c;Because we are negotiators. Also, we are friends. But Henry has wielded levers of power that I haven&#x2019;t come close to.&#x201d; In his response to Nader, Felix conveniently overlooked one important trait he shared&#x2014;and shares&#x2014;with Kissinger: an insatiable desire to control all that is written about him. Accordingly, Nader also dubbed Felix &#x201c;the Teflon investment banker&#x201d; for his ability to generate impressive amounts of fawning publicity that ignored some of his more questionable judgments.<br>...</p><h2>Horseshoe Crabs and Shorebirds: The Story of a Food Web</h2><p><p>Each spring, hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs crawl from the bottom of Delaware Bay to lay billions of pearly green eggs on the beaches. Their salty eggs provide a feast for scavenging coastal animals, but billions more are eaten by the flocks of shorebirds that stop to rest and feed each spring after flying north from their homes in South America. In recent years the horseshoe crab population has dwindled. In turn, the number of shorebirds that fly north each year has grown smaller. Illuminated with warm, detailed watercolors, <i>Horseshoe Crabs and Shorebirds</i> demonstrates the delicate relationship between these animals and is an excellent resource for ecology lessons, as well as a dramatic storybook for sharing.</p></p><p>Author Victoria Crenson has explored the shoreline up and down the east coast of the United States from Maine to Florida. Her previous books include <em>Birds of the World</em> and <em>Bay Shore Park: The Death and Life of an Amusement Park</em>. She lives in Baltimore, Maryland.<br>Illustrator Annie Cannon has illustrated a number of nature titles, including <em>Tale of a Tadpole</em>, <em>The Bat in the Boot</em>, and <em>Ma Jiang and the Orange Ants</em>. She lives in Portland, Oregon.Gr. 2-4. In picture-book format, this volume presents a particular food web in the Delaware Bay. The story begins with the spring journey of horseshoe crabs to mate and lay their eggs on the beach, and the parallel migration of shorebirds from South America to the Arctic, stopping to feed on the eggs. Meanwhile a peregrine falcon preys on the birds; minnows, crabs, and a heron feast on the eggs; and more birds attack stranded horseshoe crabs. Finally, some of the eggs hatch, continuing the cycle that will lead to another spring's mating, nesting, and feasting. Attractive as well as informative, Cannon's paintings offer close-up views of the action. Crenson's narrative approach will not suit every young researcher, but her text gives a good idea of how the food web operates in a specific locale. And perhaps all ecology, like all politics, <i>is</i> local. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p><h2>B.K.S.

He comes into my unconscious to find me, to pull me out. He seizes my logical mind and disables it with fear. I awake already panic-stricken, afraid I won&#x2019;t answer the voice correctly, the loud, clear voice that reverberates in my head like an alarm that can&#x2019;t be turned off.<br><br><i>What did you eat last night?</i><br><br>Since we first met when I was twelve he&#x2019;s been with me, at me, barking orders. A drill sergeant of a voice that is pushing me forward, marching ahead, keeping time. When the voice isn&#x2019;t giving orders, it&#x2019;s counting. Like a metronome, it is predictable. I can hear the tick of another missed beat and in the silence between beats I anxiously await the next tick; like the constant noise of an intermittently dripping faucet, it keeps counting in the silences when I want to be still. It tells me to never miss a beat. It tells me that I will get fat again if I do.<br><br>The voice and the ticks are always very loud in the darkness of the early morning. The silences that I can&#x2019;t fill with answers are even louder. God, what did I eat? Why can&#x2019;t I remember?<br><br>I breathe deeply in an attempt to calm my heartbeat back to its resting pulse. As I do, my nostrils are filled with stale cigarette smoke that hung around from the night before like a party guest who&#x2019;d passed out on the living room sofa after everybody else went home. The digital clock reads 4:06, nine minutes before my alarm was set to wake me. I need to use the restroom, but I can&#x2019;t get out of bed until I can remember what I ate.<br><br>My pupils dilate to adjust to the darkness as if searching for an answer in my bedroom. It&#x2019;s not coming. The fact that it&#x2019;s not coming makes me afraid. As I search for the answer, I perform my routine check. Breasts, ribs, stomach, hip bones. I grab roughly at these parts of my body to make sure everything is as I left it, a defensive measure, readying myself for the possible attack from my panic-addled brain. At least I slept. The last few nights I&#x2019;ve been too empty and restless, too flighty&#x2014;like I need to be weighted to my bed and held down before I can surrender to sleep. I&#x2019;ve been told that sleep is good for weight loss. It recalibrates your metabolism and shrinks your fat cells. But why it would be better than moving my legs all night as if I were swimming breaststroke I don&#x2019;t really know. Actually, now that I think about it, it must be bullshit. Swimming like someone is chasing me would have to burn more calories than lying motionless like a fat, lazy person. I wonder how long I&#x2019;ve been that way. Motionless. I wonder if that will affect my weight loss today.<br><br>I feel my heartbeat, one, two, three&#x2014;it&#x2019;s quickening. I start breathing deeply to stop from panicking, IN one two, OUT three four . . .<br><br><i>Start counting</i><br><br><i>60</i><br><br><i>30</i><br><br><i>10 =</i><br><br><i>100</i><br><br>I start over. I need to factor in the calories burned. Yesterday I got out of bed and walked directly to the treadmill and ran at 7.0 for 60 minutes for a total of negative 600 calories. I ate 60 calories of oatmeal with Splenda and butter spray and black coffee with one vanilla-flavored tablet. I didn&#x2019;t eat anything at all at work. And at lunch I walked on the treadmill in my dressing room for the hour. Shit. I had only walked. The fan I had rigged on the treadmill to blow air directly into my face so my makeup wouldn&#x2019;t be ruined had broken. That&#x2019;s not true, actually. Because I&#x2019;m so lazy and disorganized, I&#x2019;d allowed the battery to run down so the plastic blades spun at the speed of a seaside Ferris wheel. I need that fan because my makeup artist is holding me on virtual probation at work. While I am able to calm down the flyaway hairs that spring up on my head after a rigorous workout, the mascara residue that deposits under my eyes tells the story of my activities during my lunch break. She had asked me to stop working out at lunch. I like Sarah and I don&#x2019;t want to make her job more difficult, but quitting my lunchtime workout isn&#x2019;t an option. So I bought a fan and some rope and put together a rig that, when powered by fully charged batteries, simulates a head-on gale-force wind and keeps me out of trouble.<br><br>As I sit up in bed staring into the darkness, my feet making small circles to start my daily calorie burn, I feel depressed and defeated. I know what I ate last night. I know what I did. All of my hard work has been undone. And I&#x2019;m the one who undid it. I start moving my fingers and thumbs to relieve the anxiety of not beginning my morning workout because I&#x2019;m stuck here again having to answer the voice in my head.<br><br>It&#x2019;s time to face last night. It was yogurt night, when I get my yogurt ready for the week. It&#x2019;s a dangerous night because there&#x2019;s always a chance of disaster when I allow myself to handle a lot of food at one time. But I had no indication that I was going to be in danger. I had eaten my 60-calorie portion of tuna normally, using chopsticks and allowing each bite of canned fish to be only the height and width of the tips of the chopsticks themselves. After dinner, I smoked cigarettes to allow myself the time I needed to digest the tuna properly and to feel the sensation of fullness. I went to the kitchen feeling no anxiety as I took out the tools I needed to perform the weekly operation: the kitchen scale, eight small plastic containers, one blue mixing bowl, Splenda, my measuring spoon, and my fork. I took the plain yogurt out of the fridge and, using the kitchen scale, divided it among the plastic containers adding one half teaspoon of Splenda to each portion. When I was satisfied that each portion weighed exactly two ounces, I then strategically hid the containers in the top section of the freezer behind ice-crusted plastic bags of old frozen vegetables so the yogurt wouldn&#x2019;t be the first thing I saw when I opened the freezer door.<br><br>Nothing abnormal so far.<br><br>With that, I went back to the sofa and allowed some time to pass. I knew that the thirty minutes it takes for the yogurt to reach the perfect consistency of a Dairy Queen wasn&#x2019;t up, and that checking in on it was an abnormality, but that&#x2019;s exactly what I did. I walked into the kitchen, I opened the freezer, and I looked at it. And I didn&#x2019;t just look at the portion I was supposed to eat. I looked at all of it.<br><br>I slammed the freezer door shut and went back to the living room. I sat on the dark green vinyl sofa facing the kitchen and smoked four cigarettes in a row to try to take away the urge for that icy-cold sweetness, because only when I stopped wanting it would I allow myself to have it. I didn&#x2019;t take my eyes off the freezer the whole time I sat smoking, just in case my mind had tricked me into thinking I was smoking when I was actually at that freezer bingeing. Staring at the door was the only way I could be certain that I wasn&#x2019;t opening it. By now the thirty minutes had definitely passed and it was time to eat my portion. I knew the best thing for me in that moment would be to abstain altogether, because eating one portion was the equivalent of an alcoholic being challenged to have one drink. But my overriding fear was that the pendulum would swing to the other extreme if I skipped a night. I&#x2019;ve learned that overindulging the next day to make up for the 100 calories in the &#x201c;minus&#x201d; column from the day before is a certainty.<br><br>I took out my one allotted portion at 8:05 and mashed it with a fork until it reached the perfect consistency. But instead of sitting on the sofa savoring every taste in my white bowl with green flowers, using the fork to bring it to my mouth, I ate the yogurt from the plastic container over the kitchen sink with a teaspoon. I ate it fast. The deviation from the routine, the substitution of the tools, the speediness with which I ate silenced the drill sergeant and created an opening that invited in the thoughts I&#x2019;m most afraid of&#x2014;thoughts created by an evil force disguising itself as logic, poised to manipulate me with common sense. <i>Reward yourself. You ate nothing at lunch. Normal people eat four times this amount and still lose weight. It&#x2019;s only yogurt. Do it. You deserve it.</i><br><br>Before I knew it, I was on the kitchen floor cradling the plastic Tupperware containing Tuesday&#x2019;s portion in the palm of my left hand, my right hand thumb and index finger stabbing into the icy crust. I ran my numb, yogurt-covered fingers across my lips and sucked them clean before diving into the container for more. As my fingers traveled back and forth from the container to my mouth, I didn&#x2019;t have a thought in my head. The repetition of the action lulled the relentless chatter into quiet meditation. I didn&#x2019;t want this trancelike state to end, and so when the first container was done, I got up off the floor and grabbed Wednesday&#x2019;s yogurt before my brain could process that it was still only Monday. By the time I came back to my senses, I had eaten six ounces of yogurt.<br><br>The alarm on my bedside table starts beeping. It&#x2019;s 4:15 a.m. It&#x2019;s time for my morning workout. I have exactly one hour to run and do sit-ups and leg lifts before I get in the car to drive forty-five minutes to the set for my 6:00 a.m. makeup call. I don&#x2019;t have any dialogue today. I just need to stand around with the supercilious smirk of a slick, high-powered attorney while Ally McBeal runs around me in circles, working herself into a lather of nerves. But even if I&#x2019;d had actual acting to think about, my only goal today is to be comfortable in my wardrobe. God, I feel like shit. No matter how hard I run this morning, nothing can take away the damage done. As I slip out of bed and do deep lunges across the floor to the bathroom, I promise myself to cut my calorie intake in half to 150 for the day and to take twenty laxatives. That should do something to help. But it&#x2019;s not the weight gain from the six ounces of yogurt that worries me. It&#x2019;s the loss of self-control. It&#x2019;s the fear that maybe I&#x2019;ve lost it for good. I start sobbing now as I lunge my way across the floor and I wonder how many calories I&#x2019;m burning by sobbing. Sobbing and lunging&#x2014;it&#x2019;s got to be at least 30 calories. It crosses my mind to vocalize my thoughts of self-loathing, because speaking the thoughts that fuel the sobs would have to burn more calories than just thinking the thoughts and so I say, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re nothing. You&#x2019;re average. You&#x2019;re an ordinary, average, fat piece of shit. You have no self-control. You&#x2019;re a stupid, fat, disgusting dyke. You ugly, stupid, bitch!&#x201d; As I reach the bathroom and wipe away the last of my tears, I&#x2019;m alarmed by the silence; the voice has stopped.<br><br>When it&#x2019;s quiet in my head like this, that&#x2019;s when the voice doesn&#x2019;t need to tell me how pathetic I am. I know it in the deepest part of me. When it&#x2019;s quiet like this, that&#x2019;s when I truly hate myself.<br><br>� 2010 Portia de Rossi</p><h2>Half Bad (The Half Bad Trilogy)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;An enthralling fantasy in the Harry Potter tradition.&#x201d;&#x2014; <i>Time </i>magazine</b><br><br> <b>&#x201c;A bewitching new thriller.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i> The Wall Street Journal</i></b><p><br> In modern-day England, witches live alongside humans: White witches, who are good; Black witches, who are evil; and sixteen-year-old Nathan, who is both.

Lane Demas charts how African Americans nationwide organized social campaigns, filed lawsuits, and went to jail in order to desegregate courses; he also provides dramatic stories of golfers who boldly confronted wider segregation more broadly in their local communities. As national civil rights organizations debated golf's symbolism and whether or not to pursue the game's integration, black players and caddies took matters into their own hands and helped shape its subculture, while UGA participants forged one of the most durable black sporting organizations in American history as they fought to join the white Professional Golfers' Association (PGA). <br><br>From George F. Grant's invention of the golf tee in 1899 to the dominance of superstar Tiger Woods in the 1990s, this revelatory and comprehensive work challenges stereotypes and indeed the fundamental story of race and golf in American culture.<br><br></p><p>Lane Demas is professor of history at Central Michigan University.<i>Game of Privilege</i> uncovers a little-known history of African American participation in golf, a sport long perceived as the exclusive domain of wealthy whites. Demas persuasively argues that well before the advent of Tiger Woods, black golfers made important contributions to the twentieth-century struggle for equality. Through careful examination and analysis, <i>Game of Privilege</i><i> </i>moves golf from the periphery to the center of the conversation about race and sports in America.--Tomiko Brown-Nagin, author of the Bancroft Prize&#x2013;winning book <i>Courage to Dissent</i><br>Demas takes his readers on a fascinating golf outing, along the way introducing his audience to a wide range of compelling stories that not only describe the history of African American participation in a game that, as his title states, has strong associations with white privilege in American society but also shows how those who fought to integrate golf courses engaged in actions that proved to be important to the civil rights movement.--John Bloom, author of <i>There You Have It</i><br>With the exception of Bill Spiller's well-documented protests of American golf's apartheid system, black golfers have not garnered a place in the rich radical milieu of the black athlete. But Lane Demas's exploration&nbsp;<i>Game of Privilege</i> is a rearrangement of that understanding. It&nbsp;constructs an important new narrative about black golfers against the backdrop of racial supremacy that illuminates how and why progeny of enslaved Africans--men and women, golfers and not--waged a struggle, sometimes bloody and deadly, against the game in the Western hemisphere.--Kevin Blackistone, Washington Post sports columnist, ESPN panelist, and visiting professor at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland<br><br></p><h2>Jingle Bells, Homework Smells: A Christmas Holiday Book for Kids (Gilbert the Opossum)</h2><p><p><b></b></p><b>No time for homework! </b><p></p><p>When Mrs. Byrd gives the class homework for the weekend, Gilbert just can't seem to find the time to do it.

So of course, everyone in the town of Windy Flats always counts on his speed when a message has to get out fast. Then something new comes to town: the telegraph, which can send Morse code messages with the speed of electricity. At first, no one believes the newfangled contraption can deliver a message quicker than Jackrabbit. . . . But in a race between man and machine, who will be left in the dust? <br> &nbsp;<br> An author's note includes information about the invention of the telegraph, a Morse code key, and a riddle written in Morse code for kids to transcribe.<br><br>"A strikingly accomplished debut.... A terrific tall tale about the costs and opportunities of technology." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, Starred<br><br>"Good, quick-moving fun. Kids may marvel that communication existed before the telephone and Internet." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>Lucy Margaret Rozier makes her picture-book debut with <i>Jackrabbit McCabe and the Electric Telegraph</i>. She grew up folk dancing and drawing in North Carolina and worked for many years as a fine artist and a commercial artist in the Boston area. She has two grown daughters and lives in her native North Carolina with her husband and their dog, Rosie.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leo Espinosa&#x2019;s illustrations have graced the pages of the <i>New Yorker, Wired,</i> <i>Esquire,</i> and the <i>New York Times,</i> among many other publications.

Espinosa is just as successful: his crisply angular drawings, comic expressiveness, and cinematic framings bring to mind Chuck Jones&#x2019;s classic 'Dover Boys' cartoon. It&#x2019;s a terrific tall tale about the costs and opportunities of technology, and it may assuage a few parents worried about its impact on their own offspring&#x2019;s future employability&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly,</i>&nbsp;Starred<br><br>"Readers will find that the story, written in folksy terms and rhythms, clips along at a fast pace, and the fittingly retro illustrations are filled with action, energy, and good humor.

The backmatter includes a helpful historical author's note, a Morse code key, and a riddle in Morse code for readers to solve. Good, quick-moving fun. Kids may marvel that communication existed before the telephone and Internet." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews<br></i><br>"In the tall-tale tradition of John Henry, McCabe engages in a man-versus-machine competition by&nbsp;trying to deliver a message more quickly than it can be sent by telegraph. The telegram arrives before&nbsp;McCabe, but this original story still ends happily. McCabe&#x2019;s speedy fingers are adept with Morse code,&nbsp;leading to a perfect job as a telegraph operator. Using Photoshop and pencil, Espinosa creates colorful,&nbsp;dynamic images that burst from the page. An imaginative book design includes McCabe leaping across a&nbsp;two-page spread, or multiple smaller images showing rapid motion, communicating action and speed&nbsp;throughout." &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></p><h2>Lonely Planet Naples, Pompeii &amp; the Amalfi Coast (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world&#x2019;s number one travel guide publisher* </i></p> <p><b>Lonely Planet&#x2019;s <i>Naples, Pompeii &amp; the Amalfi Coast</i> </b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Do you absorb other people's feelings like a sponge? Do you find yourself drowning in these feelings and sensations? Do you feel that your acute sensitivity sometimes lets toxic people in and makes you into a victim?</b><br><b></b> <br>If yes, you might be an empath, a Highly Sensitive Person who is finely tuned in to energy but who can also get overwhelmed because of this tendency to notice details.<br> <br>In <b><i>The Empath's Journey</i></b>, San Francisco Bay Area-based writer Ritu Kaushal takes you on an intimate journey to rediscover and recover what it means to be an emotional empath and a Highly Sensitive Person. Combining personal stories with insights from Jungian Depth Psychology, Transactional Analysis and Art Therapy, <b><i>The Empath's Journey</i></b> shows empaths how to reclaim the core of their sensitivity from the deeply injuring stories they have been told about it.<br><br>In this behind-the-scenes look at an empath's life, we first meet the author at a pivotal point after she has relocated from India to the United States. As she gets inundated with noticing thousands of small differences in a new culture, she finds herself face-to-face with the same old dilemma: Is feeling and noticing so much really such a great thing? Over the next six years, we journey with her as she struggles with questions that every emotional empath has battled with. How do you cut through overwhelm when you feel swamped by noticing subtle details and feelings? How do you set boundaries when you almost feel other people's emotions in your own body? Is being an empath even a real thing, or is being an empath a maladaptation, the same as being codependent?<br><br> As the author cuts through the muck of old beliefs, we see her finding pieces of her answers. We accompany her as she assembles different tools to channel her crackling sensitivity so that it can be harnessed as a source of power instead of leaving her feeling overwhelmed and spinning out of control. <br><br>Instead of seeing themselves through the lens of the labels of "too weak" and "too soft," <b><i>The Empath's Journey</i></b> shows empaths that many of their struggles with being highly sensitive come from the fact that they've been taught to treat their sensitivity like a dragon, something to fight against, instead of seeing that this seeming dragon guards their very treasure.<br><br> <i>In this believing mirror of a book, you will find all those lost, wounded parts of yourself that have numbed out because they were not seen. You will also find the thread back to that soft sensitivity that makes you You, that You you have always been, and will always be.</i><br> <i></i><br><b><i>The Empath's Journey</i> is calling you back home to your sensitive self. </b></p><p>Ritu Kaushal is a San Francisco Bay Area-based author and the blogger behind the popular HSP and empath-centric website walkingthroughtransitions.com.

Ritu's work pulls together different threads, combining personal and imaginative storytelling with insights from proven psychological concepts.

These cases have baffled the experts and remained unsolved for decades. The missing person cases presented in this book have diverse backgrounds, but they are all equally mysterious. Here we will dive headfirst into some of the most unusual disappearing acts on record. Rational explanations have been put forward for some, but many lack any plausible theories whatsoever. <p></p> This book relates the true yet astonishing tales of prime ministers lost at sea, esteemed physicists vanishing without a trace, great explorers lost in the wilderness. From the World War II veteran who seemed to literally disappear into thin air on a bus ride home, to the ill-fated singer-songwriter Connie Converse who right around her 50th birthday decided to pull a &#x201c;Bilbo Baggins&#x201d; (Connie&#x2019;s own words) on the ones she loved by slipping on her very own ring of invisibility and vanishing out of sight, this book takes us through some of the saddest, the most intriguing, and the most downright bizarre accounts of lost souls that you will ever find. <p></p> <br><br> <p><b>Scroll back up and order your copy today!</b></p></p><p></p><h2>Ivy and the Lonely Raincloud</h2><p>Everyone loves the warm sunshine&#x2014;except the lonely raincloud. No one wants to be his friend! But one day, he stumbles across a grumpy little florist . . . could she be looking for a friend too?<br><br>In this charming tale, a solitary raincloud finds a way to make a sad little girl happy again, by using the very thing that most people dislike about him&#x2014;rain!</p><p>Katie Harnett grew up in Sheffield, UK, graduating with an Illustration BA at the University of the West of England followed by an MA in Children&#39;s Book Illustration at Cambridge School of Art in 2015. Her work was selected to be exhibited in The Illustrators Exhibition at the Bologna Book Fair in 2012 and 2015, where she received the Bologna Children&#39;s Book Fair ARS IN FABULA Grant Award. She is inspired by nature, old movies and photos, patterns, and the work of Cy Twombly, Tove Jansson and Eric Ravilious (amongst many others). She works using a combination of gouache, watercolour and coloured pencils. Her work has been exhibited internationally, and is included in upcoming exhibitions in Moscow and Beijing. She now lives and works in Cambridge, where her studio has many feline visitors.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Friendship can be found in the most unexpected pairings. Who would guess that a rain cloud and a little girl could become fast friends? A moody Ivy, wearing a sunny yellow dress and red shoes, is clearly not happy. The childlike illustrations emphasize Ivy's furrowed brow, crossed arms, and matching frown. Harnett uses a combination of gouache, watercolor, and colored pencils to create a fresh, folk art urban look to tell this modern tale of an unusual friendship. Patterned tablecloths, awnings, hats, and other striped details embody the vibrant city feel. Ivy standing on a "Welcome" mat as she shouts, "Leave me alone!" hints at her yearning for connection, even while her posture and her words suggest otherwise. Through changes in perspective, Harnett indicates shifts in the story and movement and growth in the understanding of the cloud. From above the street the cloud is perplexed and far from connecting with anyone but does notice a kindred lone girl in a city of people with friends. Only when the cloud comes closer and learns more about Ivy does it begin to understand her. Grumpy Ivy does not really go through the same process or epiphany, thus making the rain cloud the main character and focus of the plot. While Ivy gets first billing, the rain cloud is truly the hero. VERDICT Read this book for the powerful artwork. An additional purchase for large libraries to add to their friendship collections.&#x2014;Eva Thaler-Sroussi, Glencoe Public Library, IL</p><h2>Case Studies in Forensic Accounting and Fraud Auditing (2nd Edition)</h2><p>The Forensic and Investigative Accounting Casebook is a collection of Problem-Based Learning cases designed to reinforce principles taught in forensic accounting/auditing courses throughout the United States.

In his twenty-year career, Bonds has amassed an unprecedented seven MVP awards, eight Gold Gloves, and more than seven hundred home runs, an impressive assortment of feats that has earned him consideration as one of the greatest players the game has ever seen. Equally deserved, however, is his reputation as an insufferable braggart, whose mythical home runs are rivaled only by his legendary ego. From his staggering ability and fabled pedigree (father Bobby played outfield for the Giants; cousin Reggie Jackson and godfather Willie Mays are both Hall of Famers) to his well-documented run-ins with teammates and the persistent allegations of steroid use, Bonds inspires a like amount of passion from both sides of the fence. For many, Bonds belongs beside Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron in baseball's holy trinity; for others, he embodies all that is wrong with the modern athlete: aloof; arrogant; alienated.</p><p>In <em>Love Me, Hate Me</em>, author Jeff Pearlman offers a searing and insightful look into one of the most divisive athletes of our time. Drawing on more than five hundred interviews -- with former and current teammates, opponents, managers, trainers, friends, and outspoken critics and unapologetic supporters alike -- Pearlman reveals, for the first time, a wonderfully nuanced portrait of a prodigiously talented and immensely flawed American icon whose controversial run at baseball immortality forever changed the way we look at our sports heroes.</p></p><p><p>Jeff Pearlman is a columnist for SI.com, a former Sports Illustrated senior writer, and the critically acclaimed author of <em>Boys Will Be Boys</em>, <em>The Bad Guys Won!</em>, and <em>Love Me, Hate Me</em>. </p>Pearlman, former staff writer with <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and <i>Newsday,</i> delivers a fully realized, if hardly appealing, portrait of baseball slugger Barry Bonds, who has perplexed teammates, fans, and the press for years with sometimes-indifferent play, an almost-joyful cruelty toward seemingly everyone (except kids), and a near-total disregard for the rules of the game, if allegations of his use of performance-enhancing drugs are true. At the same time, Pearlman's Barry Bonds is a man of astonishing talent and, on occasion, humanity. Bonds' career is fully traced here--from his pampered boyhood as the son of another gifted but troubled player (Bobby Bonds) through his successes at Arizona State, through his years as a superstar with the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants, including his pursuit of Hank Aaron's home-run record. Drug-use allegations aside, it's hard not to boo Barry Bonds for the teammate and man he appears to be, so damning is Pearlman's profile. Yet the reader is always reminded of Bonds' supreme talent.

Roquelaure</h2><p>Claiming of Sleeping Beauty</p><p><b>PREFACE</b> <p></p> <p>I&#x2019;ve always loved the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, and found something erotic at its core. The Prince awakens Beauty with a kiss. And I thought, all right, what if he brought a kind of liberation, an induction into a world of bizarre yet irresistible delights? It has to be remembered that within the frame of a sadomasochistic fantasy like the Beauty trilogy, the readers are invited to identify with and enjoy the predicament of the slaves. The books aren&#x2019;t about literal cruelty; they&#x2019;re about surrender, the fun of imagining you have no choice but to enjoy sex. Beauty&#x2019;s slavery is delicious, sensuous, abandoned, and ultimately liberating. This is all part of the framework. And it seemed to work exquisitely with the old fairy tale. And of course the fairy tale removes us from everyday life; it removes us from the intrusion of garish headlines, literal violence, and all the ugliness of crime. We go into a gilded dream here, luscious and engulfing, in which we&#x2019;re free to imagine all sorts of things&#x2014;a fairy-tale world indeed.</p> <p>As Anne Rice, I&#x2019;m known for certain kinds of novels; the Roquelaure books retain the name Roquelaure (even with my name added) to indicate that this is something &#x201c;different.&#x201d; If Anne Rice is one kind of savory dish, well this is another entirely. And some might find it far too spicy for their taste. I don&#x2019;t like the idea of confusing or disappointing readers, so the pen name helps with that. Of course, there are many people who have read all my work, including the Roquelaure novels, and they see me as a multifaceted writer. But the Roquelaure material is erotica, without reservation, and it needs that pen name on the label, so to speak. The pen name says: Anne Rice is doing something very different here.</p> <p>I felt I needed the anonymity of the pen name to write freely, to pursue an authentic erotica without being inhibited or self-conscious. And it worked wonders to imagine myself &#x201c;cloaked&#x201d; by the name Roquelaure, which is a kind of French cloak&#x2014;named after the Frenchman who popularized it. My father was still living then and I didn&#x2019;t want him to know about the books either. In fact, there were lots of friends and relatives whom I didn&#x2019;t want to worry about as I developed the writing. There was quite a bit of exposure involved in writing such graphic sexual fantasies. It was frightening now and then, and it was thrilling. Eventually, I told my father about the books, asking him not to read them, and I did put my name on them. I adjusted completely to people knowing I&#x2019;d written them. But only after I&#x2019;d finished with the trilogy&#x2014;as I recall.</p> <p>A pen name enables you not only to cloak what you are doing from friends and family; it gives you a new freedom to do something you would not do as yourself. I have thought of writing some new erotica, and I must confess I imagined using a new pen name for it. I don&#x2019;t know whether I&#x2019;ll pursue it, but I do find the freedom of the pen name attractive.</p> <p>When the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy books were first published, they were underground books. They had the backing of a major mainstream publisher, yes, but the publication, though dignified and beautiful, was relatively quiet. But different readers embraced the books almost at once. They clearly appealed to young people, and older married people, to gays and straights. And they&#x2019;ve sold steadily ever since they first appeared. Women come up to me at signings with babies in strollers and giggle and laugh and say, &#x201c;We love your dirty books.&#x201d; People of all ages, actually, present the books to be signed.</p> <p>Why do I think these particular books have been popular? Two reasons. First, I think it is because they involve no harsh, garish violence at all. They involve game playing, really. No one is burned or cut or hurt. Certainly no one is killed. Indeed the whole sadomasochistic predicament is presented as a glorified game played out in luxurious rooms and with very attractive people, and involving very attractive slaves. There are endless motifs offered for dominance and submission, for surrender and love. It&#x2019;s like a theme park of dominance and submission, a place to go to enjoy the fantasy of being overpowered by a beautiful man or woman and delightfully compelled to surrender and feel keening pleasure, without the slightest serious harm. I think it&#x2019;s authentic to the way many who share this kind of fantasy really feel. I think what makes it work for people is the combination of the very graphic and unsparing sexual details mixed with the elegant fairy-tale world.</p> <p>Unfortunately a lot of hackwork pornography is written by those who don&#x2019;t share the fantasy, and they slip into hideous violence and ugliness, thinking the market wants all that, when the market never really did. Second, this is shamelessly erotic. It pulls no punches at being what it is. It&#x2019;s excessive and it is erotica. Before these books, a lot of women read what were called &#x201c;women&#x2019;s romances&#x201d; where they had to mark the few &#x201c;hot pages&#x201d; in the book. I said, well, look, try this. Maybe this is what you really want, and you don&#x2019;t have to mark the hot pages because every page is hot. Every page is about sexual fulfillment. Every page is meant to give you pleasure. There are no boring parts. Yet it&#x2019;s very &#x201c;romantic.&#x201d; And well, I think this worked.</p> <p>Lots of people enjoy imagining themselves passive, in the hands of a beautiful lover, male or female, who will force them to enjoy themselves. It&#x2019;s a common idea, and it cuts across gender and class. Men love these sorts of fantasies as much as women. And these books offer all kinds of gender combinations; women dominating men and women; men dominating men and women. The books offer ornate and seductive variations on the themes; and all of it is interwoven in stories with real characters, and again, the emphasis is on a lush, sensuous realm in which all this happens. There are very detailed descriptions of physical interaction and response; but the fairy-tale spell is sustained.</p> <p>I also went all the way with exploring the mind-set of sadomasochism as I saw it, letting the fantasy characters talk in depth about what they felt and what they enjoyed and what thrilled them as they were humiliated and overwhelmed. I suspect that for some readers, this kind of deep exploration of the mentality of the participants was entirely new.</p> <p>Is this why they appealed to so many, because people want this very combination of elements? Perhaps.</p> <p>I certainly never found the combination of elements I wanted in anyone else&#x2019;s erotica. So I offered what I could not find; a light touch; elegance; preciseness; a dreamlike kingdom; a dream in which people explore their need to be passive and to &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; that someone gorgeous and irresistible is &#x201c;making&#x201d; them do it.</p> <p>Psychiatrists have written volumes on the nature of the sadomasochistic fantasy, but when I wrote the trilogy I didn&#x2019;t know of any fiction that really enabled you to slide in it and &#x201c;play&#x201d; the way I wanted to play. So I wrote the books I couldn&#x2019;t find.</p> <p>I never thought a book as eccentric as <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> would have mass appeal. I only knew that I wanted to &#x201c;be with the vampire&#x201d; in the story, tell it from his point of view. I wanted to be inside his head and heart and reveal his voice and his pain. Now as it turned out, other people were exploring this same kind of thing&#x2014;the backstory of the villain, the monster, or the comic book hero and heroine who&#x2019;d always been described from a distance or in brittle form. People wanted to explore all kinds of super characters and hear their intimate musings. And I began to see more and more of this&#x2014;movies made in which Superman could bear his soul, and Lois Lane could really talk about what it meant to love him. The demand for such romantic fantasies grew and grew. But did I have any idea that would happen? No. I wrote what I wanted to read. Well, the same thing is true with the Beauty books.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t know whether that many other people had the fantasies. After all, we didn&#x2019;t talk much about them. Only a small elite knew about the mysterious <i>Story of O</i>. But I knew I had these fantasies, and I wanted to share them, and I felt an overwhelming desire to do them &#x201c;right.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t want to compromise, water them down, or shrink from the most humiliating detail. I wanted to really delve into intense sensuous pleasure but put a gilded frame around a safe place for the reader from which he or she could go and come with ease.</p> <p>Of course these books have from time to time been banned. I never expected a library to stock the Beauty trilogy. I know that many libraries respond to community standards, and I just never thought about it much at all. I did notice and I couldn&#x2019;t help notice that the books sold well and steadily, and that at every signing I gave, people brought them to be signed. Recently, I&#x2019;ve signed as many copies of the Beauty books as I have of any other book I&#x2019;ve written. So I don&#x2019;t worry too much about being banned. I&#x2019;ve always shocked people. Years ago, I published a novel about the eighteenth-century castrati opera singers, titled <i>Cry to Heaven</i>. Someone brought a copy back to a bookstore in Stockton, California, and demanded his money back. &#x201c;This is pornography,&#x201d; he said. There are always some people objecting to what I do. I&#x2019;m grateful the Beauty books have been embraced and sustained over the years.</p> <p>As a feminist, I&#x2019;m very much supportive of equal rights for women in all walks of life. And that includes for me the right of every woman to write out her sexual fantasies and to read books filled with sexual fantasies that she enjoys. Men have always enjoyed all kinds of pornography. How can it be wrong for women to have the same right? We&#x2019;re sexual beings! And fantasy is where we can do the things we can&#x2019;t do in ordinary life. A woman has a right to imagine herself carried away by a handsome prince, and to choose for herself as she writes, the color of his hair and eyes, and imagine his silky voice. She has a right to make him as tall as she wants and as strong as he wants. Why not? Men have always allowed themselves such fantasies.</p> <p>Famous madams have told us for decades that powerful men love to be dominated and come to them for role playing that allows the male client to be passive. In fact, some madams have said that men who enjoy playing the passive role are often men who are very powerful in real life. Well, women today are more powerful than ever. They&#x2019;re Supreme Court judges, senators, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, executives, soldiers, cops. They can excel in all walks of life. And why shouldn&#x2019;t they be able to go home from the courtroom, the university, or the office and kick back and &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; they&#x2019;re being swept away to the Queen&#x2019;s sadomasochistic kingdom where all the fairy-tale court will watch them being ravaged by the handsome Prince?</p> <p>The literary world today is wide open for all kinds of creative endeavors. We are in a new golden age in which fantasy, science fiction, speculative fiction, historical drama, horror, gothic, and supernatural romance are all mainstream. Well, the same holds true now obviously for erotica. People in general are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; as enjoyers of erotic books. The novel <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> has proved this. And I am discovering that the Beauty books in spite of all their playful excess&#x2014;are for the first time going mainstream.</p> <p>But I wouldn&#x2019;t continue Beauty&#x2019;s story. I felt that ended just the way I wanted. But I might write some more. I don&#x2019;t think I did all I could do in these books, within the fantasy itself, in admitting how much the slaves enjoyed it&#x2014;how they loved it. I&#x2019;d deepen that aspect, and still keep the tension, if I did them today.</p> <p>People are much more comfortable today admitting and talking about what they enjoy in fiction and film. Much more. People are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; about sexuality, period. The whole world knows women are sensual human beings as well as men. It&#x2019;s no secret anymore that women want to read sexy fiction just as men do, and there&#x2019;s a new frankness about the varieties of fantasies one might enjoy.

He likes the fresh air, the friends he makes, and the time to go fishing. Plus he makes the best hot dogs around! Suddenly, in a terrible blizzard, a school bus becomes stranded in the snow. And who comes to the rescue? Stan the Hot Dog Man!</p><p>Hot dogs save the day! Stan makes the best hot dogs around. At lunchtime, he makes lots of new friends, too. Then a snowstorm hits, and some of Stan&#39;s new friends are stranded. It&#39;s Stan the Hot Dog Man to the rescue!Grade 1-3 --A readable but sometimes stilted text introduces Stan while he is working at a bakery. He retires and immediately becomes a "hot dog man" in his own van, parked on a popular street corner. Stan is very happy, and his business is doing well until he is stranded in a snow storm, along with a school bus. The children and the bus driver climb into the hot dog van and enjoy themselves while waiting for the snow plow to rescue them. Kessler uses gently washed pen-and-ink drawings to add interest and detail to the story. Stan is just grandfatherly enough and his wife Emma is a perfect grandmotherly match as his friend and companion.

On Saturday morning, Molly brought him over to hang out at our house, along with his buddy Grayson. We'd never met Grayson, nor had we met Grayson's mom and dad. We didn't know what they were like, where they were from, or what they did for a living, but we did know something about them. They left clear evidence-in Grayson.<br><br>We live on a couple acres of Colorado land with a big barn and a swimming pool. There are signs everywhere that this has been home to seven children: a trampoline, a rope to swing on, a well-worn four-wheeler, and lots of indoor "techno toys." It's a place our kids-Kristin, Tara, Michael, Molly, Charlene, Jazzy, and Natasha-have truly enjoyed. So for many hours the boys had tons of fun and the day flew by.<br><br>Around 7 p.m., Molly yelled, "Guys, time to go!" Hearing high-energy footsteps and the swift opening and closing of doors, we assumed they'd all left the house, so we were startled when Grayson appeared in our living room.<br><br>"Thanks for letting me come over, Mr. and Mrs. Miller!"<br><br>"You're welcome," we replied. "Hope you had fun."<br><br>"I sure did!"<br><br>"Come again, okay?" Karen said.<br><br>"I will. Thanks!"<br><br>"Terrific! See ya, Grayson."<br><br>"Okay. Have a good evening. Bye!"<br><br>Hmm, did we just interact with an engaging young person who demonstrated courtesy and gratitude? Did he actually say, "Have a good evening"?<br><br>And instantly we knew this: He didn't pick any of that up by watching television. He learned it from his mom and dad because, like children everywhere, he is a product of his parents' parenting.<br><br>Some people will pursue the "nature versus nurture" debate, but we'd rather not go there in this book. Sure, some traits or characteristics might be born into our kids, but the danger in thinking about the impact of "nature" is that we'll use nature as an excuse for whatever our children are like if we're not careful. Since this book is focused on how to raise accountable kids and embracing personal accountability in parenting, we prefer to encourage all dads and moms-including ourselves-to not look beyond how we parent for reasons why our children think, feel, or act the way they do. Today many people talk about "character building" for children and that's important, but the truth is, the character of a child is rooted in the way he or she is raised.<br><br>We know that this is a difficult notion for some parents to accept, so we're going to say it early to set a tone of personal accountability:<br><br>If parents have problems with their teen, they likely had problems with their toddler.<br><br>Recently, a parent shared this with us:<br><br>Our eighth-grade son is driving us crazy! Each week he's supposed to empty all of the trash cans in the house, consolidate the garbage into bags-not cans-and place them by the curb for pickup. But he routinely places one of our large cans on the street instead, knowing it's the wrong way to do it! And this isn't the only area we see this sort of behavior. When he doesn't set his alarm at night and oversleeps, he blames his sister for not getting him up. If we tell him to stop playing games on the computer and do his homework instead, he initially ignores us and then says we're "mean." When he doesn't practice his piano lesson, he takes absolutely no accountability for his lack of preparedness for the next time he's with his teacher. What do we do? Help!<br><br>This is an awfully frustrating situation-and we truly feel for these parents-but problems like these don't appear overnight. They are a result of the parents' practices through the child's lifetime. So the wrong questions to ask are "Why is my child so difficult?" and "When will he change?" (We refer to these kinds of questions as Incorrect Questions, or IQs.) The right questions would be "What have I done to create my current problems?" and "How can I start parenting differently?" Questions like these, which we call QBQs and will explore in-depth in Chapter Four, not only represent accountable thinking but also lead to learning-and where there is learning there is change. For many parents, one key change needed is the willingness to adopt this principle:<br><br>My child is a product of my parenting.<br><br>We know that some will want to debate this, pointing to other influences in a child's life. It's understandable. But we've found it's easier to practice personal accountability in our parenting by not fighting this principle and instead embracing it. With this premise in place, regardless of the age of the child, any parent can become the outstanding mom or dad they wish to be. And that is where raising accountable kids begins-with the parent.<br><br>� Chapter Two �<br><br>Parenting Is a Learned Skill<br><br>Before I got married, I had six theories about bringing up children; now I have six children, and no theories.<br><br>-John Wilmot<br><br>Karen settled into her seat for a two-hour flight. Directly behind her sat an adorable little boy, about four years old, flanked by his parents. Like most normal little guys, he was pretty active. Karen knew this because he was kicking her seat nonstop and they hadn't even lifted off!<br><br>This continued for several minutes until the dad threatened his son:<br><br>"If you keep kicking the lady's seat, Santa won't bring you anything for Christmas."<br><br>Overhearing the father's statement, Karen felt bad for the child. She was tempted to turn around to say, "It's okay. No problem!" but before she could, the behavior worsened-not the child's but the parents' behavior! The mom chimed in with this menacing message: "If you don't stop now, the police will come and take you to jail."<br><br>After the flight got under way, the little tyke settled down with a coloring book. All was peaceful, until the mom admonished, "You're coloring too hard. You're going to break the crayons. And stay inside the lines!"<br><br>About twenty minutes later the boy was given a DVD player with no headphones and allowed to loudly broadcast a movie for the next hour, disrupting the conversations, thoughts, and sleep of passengers all around him!<br><br>When the flight ended and the deplaning process began, Karen heard the couple say this: "Now I know why my parents gave us a shot of brandy before we traveled. Maybe we should try that next time!"<br><br>We all know that flying with small children can be challenging, but certainly we can all agree that the parents in this story could have handled their young son in a more effective manner. There is no doubt that they could benefit from a few parenting tips-but what mom or dad can't improve? The truth is this: Parenting is a learned skill. When moms and dads just "wing it" and don't seek any training to be the best parents they can be, the results they get may not be the results they hoped for when they chose the job. The truth is, we can all absorb new ideas, implement new practices, and form new habits-and when we do, both the parent and the child win.<br><br>� Chapter Three �<br><br>They're Watching Us<br><br>Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them.<br><br>-James Baldwin<br><br>Hearing the phone ring, the parent yells to the eight-year-old, "Tell them I'm not home!"<br><br>A decade later, the parent yells at the eighteen-year-old, "Where did you learn to lie?"<br><br>Here's an unyielding, never-changing principle:<br><br>Modeling is the most powerful of all teachers.<br><br>So often we hear people blame Hollywood celebrities, politicians, and famous athletes for being poor role models. "How dare famous people fall off their pedestals and fail our kid," they lament. (Of course, these are pedestals that we should never have put them on in the first place.) Some parents even point fingers at teachers, coaches, clergy, neighbors, relatives, and family friends for "setting a poor example."<br><br>Who is the most critical role model for your child? Any answer other than "Me!" is a form of blame. If we want to raise accountable kids, we must avoid using other people and outside influences as excuses for what our child is or becomes. The outstanding parent who knows who the real role model is for their child asks this accountable question-a QBQ: "How can I set a better example today?"<br><br>Here's an idea: Before we worry about the negative impact those outside our families might have on our children, let's consider:<br><br>If I don't want my kid to text while he drives, I'd better not do it myself.<br><br>If I don't want my kid to go to R-rated movies, I should not see them, either.<br><br>If I don't want my children to speak harshly to each other, I should watch my tone. If I don't want my kid using foul words, I might want to keep my language in check.<br><br>If I don't want my kid to complain about others, I should temper my own criticisms.<br><br>If I don't want my kid to blame, I shouldn't scream at the ref during the Little League game.<br><br>If I want my kid to get more exercise, I better dust off my bicycle and take a ride.<br><br>If I want my kid to be friendly and outgoing, I should go meet the new neighbors.<br><br>If I want my kid to handle money well, I need to do the same.<br><br>Identify the behaviors you want your child to exhibit and then ask, "What can I do today to engage in these behaviors in my life?" That's accountable parenting, and that's how we raise accountable kids!<br><br>Remember, they're watching us.<br><br>� Chapter Four �<br><br>QBQ! The Question Behind the Question<br><br>A prudent question is one half of wisdom.<br><br>-Francis Bacon<br><br>Personal accountability is a powerful principle, one that we want our children to learn and learn well! As parents, we teach accountability to our kids by eliminating victim thinking, complaining, procrastination, and blame from our parenting. When we lament about what our children are doing or not doing, when we delay action while waiting for others to "do something," when we point fingers looking for "whodunit"-we are not putting personal accountability into action.<br><br>But we can, and we do it through a tool called the QBQ.<br><br>QBQ stands for "The Question Behind the Question," and here's how it is defined:<br><br>QBQ is a tool that enables parents to practice personal accountability by making better choices in the moment.<br><br>And we accomplish this by asking better questions of ourselves. When faced with a parenting problem or frustration, our minds first tend to fill with questions like "Why won't my kids listen?" and "When will they do what I ask?" These questions are natural and understandable, but by focusing on everything and everyone except the person asking them, they demonstrate a lack of personal accountability. It's only when we stop and look behind those first questions that we find better ones-QBQs-like "What can I do differently?" and "How can I improve as a parent?" Asking these questions turns the focus back on ourselves and to what we can do to make a difference. It's nearly impossible to overstate the positive impact this simple change can have on our lives-and on our families.<br><br>The QBQ is a practical parenting tool that has three easy-to-apply guidelines to show us how to construct accountable questions:<br><br>1. QBQs begin with the words "What" or "How"-not "Why," "When," or "Who."<br><br>a. "Why?" questions lead to victim thinking and complaining, as in "Why is parenting so hard?" or "Why isn't my child a better student?"<br><br>b. "When?" questions lead to procrastination, as in "When will my kids start doing what I ask?" or "When will someone take care of that problem?"<br><br>c. "Who?" questions lead to blame and finger-pointing, as in "Who did it?" or "Who's going to help my child get better grades?"<br><br>2. QBQs contain the personal pronoun "I"-not "they," "you," or even "we"-because I can change only me. Example: "What can I do?"<br><br>3. QBQs always focus on action. Personal accountability is all about engaging in positive behavior now, making it possible for us to contribute and make a difference.<br><br>The underlying concept of the QBQ is this:<br><br>The answers are in the questions.<br><br>When we ask better questions, we get better answers. The QBQ guidelines show us how to build-and ask-better questions. We'll also explore the types of questions to avoid asking, but first here's a key point: QBQs are questions we generally ask of ourselves. The QBQ is a tool designed to help us reframe our own thinking. Certainly, there are some QBQs we can speak out loud-such as "What can I do to serve you?"-but more often than not a QBQ is a better question that we each ask of ourselves, because it's all about us discovering those better answers.<br><br>Furthermore, just as the QBQ helps us ask better questions, it guides us in making better choices. Parents have countless opportunities each day to make choices. And what is it that we are always choosing? Our next thought. A compelling opportunity for change exists in these individual moments when we can change our thinking. By helping us make better choices, the QBQ enables us to take charge of our thoughts and literally transform our lives-and our parenting.<br><br>We know that moms and dads are looking for practical tools, and it's our belief that the QBQ is the how-to needed to parent more effectively. And to learn how to apply the QBQ, we must have some language and structure. "Incorrect Questions" (IQs) are the "Why?," "When?," and "Who?" questions that lead to victim thinking, complaining, procrastination, and blame. If you compare IQs with QBQs, you'll see how simple it can be to put the QBQ into action:<br><br>IQ QBQ<br><br>Why doesn't my daughter ever take my advice? What can I do to understand her needs?<br><br>When will my son open up to me? How can I build a more trusting relationship?<br><br>Who made the mess in here? What can I do to help my child learn good habits?<br><br>Take a moment to review the IQ/QBQ comparisons above. Be aware of how it feels to ask an accountable question, a QBQ. Imagine the difference bringing more personal accountability to our parenting will make in our families. And rest assured, employing QBQs is a practice one can engage in immediately!<br><br>Cory, a thirtysomething salesperson and father of two boys, attended a corporate QBQ training session. Recognizing the value of the QBQ beyond the workplace, he was excited to try it with his family. With the notion of IQs and QBQs fresh in his mind, he pulled his sons to his side and asked, "Boys, what can I do to be a better dad for you?"</p><h2>Gout. Gout diet and gout treatment.

Eighteen years in the writing, this deceptively simple book kindles the human spirit in the manner of a modern classic, its gentle message inviting each of us to witness that &#34;a miracle is often the willingness to see the common in an uncommon way.&#34;Jacob is a poor but pious figure who rises anonymously before dawn to light the ovens in the town bakery. As the ovens are warming and the first dough rising Jacob turns inward, scribbling notes to himself -- thoughts and observations ringing with the clarity of a soul unencumbered by &#34;the weight of its own importance.&#34;One of Jacob&#39;s carefully folded notes is accidentally baked into a loaf of bread. When it is discovered and read, its impact is overwhelming. The secret of Jacob soon becomes a whisper that rides the wind into every ear, and the community embraces Jacob &#34;as if he were a long-ignored human treasure suddenly unearthed.&#34;Adults and children alike gather at the bakery or stop Jacob on the street. With patience and love, Jacob the baker finds doors for those locked within themselves and their presumptions, and turns the key to their questions.Jacob the Baker is a treasury of answers in the form of brief stories and parables, told by a baker who is a poet of truth and kindness. The questions put to Jacob are as diverse as death and charity, eternity and anger, but Jacob&#39;s responses are always a celebration of rightness, a reminder of the purpose and order in life. He is a wise and gentle friend who renews our sense of belonging to the world.Jacob the Baker can be started on any page; as Jacob would say, it doesn&#39;t matter where you start, it matters that you start.</p><p>ttle fable tells the story of a baker named Jacob, who scribbled his thoughts no bit of paper as he waited for his bread to rise. One day, a small paper was baked into a loaf and gradually people came by for bread and wisdom, and Jacob's sayings became known. Now they have been gathered into this gentle book for all to share.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Jacob is a pious, modest, self-effacing baker who writes pithy aphorisms on scraps of paper.

Ja-hee's world is gritty, dark, and filled with struggle; and so readers are swept along into her encounters with Japanese brutality and wartime events, with Ja-hee's only hope lying in a mysterious comb that is the sole remnant of her birth mother and which holds its own story of hope and survival, passed down through generations.Candid passages and descriptions are eye-opening and revealing: "I had become an ianfu - a comfort woman. I learned a trick, too. I examined the men's boots before they raped me. As I said, the Colonel had his boots tied tight. It was a warning sign. His type of cruelty was the worst. It was psychological as well as physical. After that, whenever I saw someone with boots tied tight, I knew I would be humiliated. But there were many others. A soldier with dirty, untied boots would be careless and quick. A soldier who kept his boots on would often hurt me. If his boots were clean and polished, he would want me to pretend I was enjoying him. Examining their boots was just something I did. But knowing what was going to happen to me did not help. In fact, it made it worse. It was like a torturer telling you what he was going to do to you next. By looking at their boots, I knew how they would rape me." And being based on actual history, they hold all the more impact and importance not just for Daughters Of The Dragon, but for a deeper understanding of modern-day Asia and why the Japanese are still viewed with caution and anger throughout much of the rest of the region.That the story of comfort women has all but been forgotten, buried by the Japanese government, is a shame. That it's resurrected here in Daughters Of The Dragon and woven into a fictional story of survival to make it accessible to a much wider audience than nonfiction could have achieved is an even more commendable choice.William Andrews has taken a nearly-buried historical fact and used it to create a masterpiece of fictional encounters cemented by a strong central character in Ja-hee.Readers who look for authentic historical meaning, strong protagonists, believable and involving dialogue, and a gripping saga will find Daughters Of The Dragon just the ticket. Anticipate brutal scenes, revelations, and struggles for survival and post-traumatic stress that follow the realistic paths of life in a powerful story of dignity, atrocities and roads to recovery.It's a shame this story hasn't been fully explored before. It's a revelation that's long needed exposure, and it's outstanding that Andrews has seen fit to research and bring it to public attention now, in a format accessible to more than just history buffs and scholars.Gayle Pace &#x2013; BE MI OWN BOOK REVIEWS July 2014 I found the book to be quite an education on the history of Korea, The book was very well researched. Things such as Empress Myeongseong, Japanese occupation, military interventions in WWII and the countless millions who died or were left without homes. The story is told by the voice of Ja-hee, a "comfort woman". The story is based around a 14 year old taken from her family to service the Japanese military. She is strong and survives because of that strength. She was very smart, lots of courage and lots of strength. The author introduces us to her ancestors, her family and the descendants. Returning to Korea, her granddaughter is in search of her birth mother. Here is the person who will tell Ja-hee's story to the world. The book at times is very emotional, the characters are well developed, and as you read the book, you find that it is about history that should not be repeated.The longer you read, the harder it is to put the book down. The descriptions are very vivid which brings the story to reality. Historical truths can be quite sad and this was definitely one of them. But all in all it had to be told. The book is about struggling to survive. Lovely cover.Joan Adamak &#x2013; JOAN'S MUSINGS and Amazon Top Reviewer This book is one of the finest books I have read in a long time. It is a tragic and triumphant telling of the atrocities that over 200,000 Korean women (usually young teenage girls) had to endure at the hands of Japanese soldiers during WWII. At this time, Korea was subject to Japan and its soldiers and were helpless to deal with the situation. In this particular Korean family, the mother was sent to work long hours in a factory producing for the Japanese;, the father was taken by the Japanese and made to fight for them where he died; and Ja-hee, age 14, and her sister were told they were to work in a boot factory. When they got there, they joined other teenage Korean girls who were forced to be sex slaves for the Japanese military and treated in the most vicious manners possible. During war times, soldiers quite often become immune to human suffering and take out on the weaker their anger, and women most often are picked up and put into brothels or such and bear the brunt of this anger.This story tells of those times, what happened to these girls, what public opinion was about them by Koreans, Japanese and American soldiers at the end of the war and how Korean split into North and South because of political division. Ja-Hee, using her intelligence, struggled to survive, including finding her sister after she believed she had been dead over sixty years. This story is well written, the dialogue is emotional and believable and the scenes are so well depicted, it is like the reader is there.Other Independent Reviews.I did not want to put this book down. I enjoyed the writing style as much as my other favorite authors (Archer, Follett, Silva, Grisham). The book influenced my perspective on the stigmas we inadvertently and intentionally place on the marginalized in society. I love a good book that changes my heart. And I now know much more about 20th Century Korean history. I will be one of the first to pick up his next book. Please, someone, turn this book into a movie. &#x2013; Barnes and Noble Independent Reviewer A well written and exceptional historical novel that describes not only the atrocities, but also the gut-wrenching personal feelings suffered by the Comfort Women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese prior to and during the II World War. An exceptional young woman is followed through her life from innocent childhood, through a horrific sexual experience as a comfort woman, to old age, allowing the reader to understand and experience her feelings and the very difficult recovery that was forced on these women who managed to escape and then discover that their life was forever after, altered by the social norms of the Korean society that could not accept the atrocities that had occurred. Through the inclusion of a mysterious two headed dragon comb, the author has placed the story into a historical context that provides the reader with view of Korean history, from Empress Myeongseong, assassinated in 1895 resisting the Japanese to the formation of North and South Korea as separate nation-states and invasion of American forces. The dragon comb becomes the &#x201c;gun in the drawer&#x201d; that adds mystery and keeps the reader always wanting to keep reading the next chapter to find out how the story is going to end. This book is so well written that I read this book in two days. This is a thought provoking and well-constructed story that everyone should read. This book should definitely reach the New York Times best sellers list. &#x2013; Amazon Independent Reviewer I invite you to read the first page then tell me you weren't immediately drawn in. Ja-hee's story of suffering, endurance and survival is not only an inspirational story, it serves as a glimpse into the shameful depravity to which humans can descend in their treatment of others. While this is an historical novel, Mr. Andrews exhaustive research into the subject imbues the story line with the resiliency of truth. And the dialogue and narrative of a Korean woman, from youth to old age, is so credible and so alive, the reader finds himself from time to time checking if indeed the author is that white male pictured on the dustcover. Daughters of the Dragon is a remarkable story, extraordinarily well-crafted. &#x2013; Barnes &amp; Nobel Independent Reviewer</p><h2>For a New Generation: A Practical Guide for Revitalizing Your Church</h2><p>In <i>For a New Generation</i>, Lee Kricher outlines five practical change strategies for church leaders and members who are committed to reversing or avoiding church decline.&nbsp;This book is not about changing your church's statement of faith.

The twists and turns of the series, as well as the psychological depth and complexity of J. K. Rowling&#x2019;s characters, have kept fans enthralled with and puzzling over the many mysteries that permeate Hogwarts and beyond: Do the Harry Potter books encourage disobedience? Why is everyone so fascinated by Professor Lupin? What exactly will Harry and his friends do when they finally pass those N.E.W.T.s? Do even wizards live by the ticking of the clock? Is Harry destined to end up alone? And why did it take Ron and Hermione so long to get together? Now, in The Psychology of Harry Potter, leading psychologists delve into the ultimate Chamber of Secrets, analyzing human mind and motivation by examining the themes and characters that make the Harry Potter books the bestselling fantasy series of all time.

The selections are by professors, psychoanalysts, graduate students, and clinical psychologists. Robin Rosenberg's "What Do Students Learn from Hogwarts Classes?" seems a well-suited (and entertaining) addition to the syllabus of an education major, not "just" a Potter enthusiast. Some of the genuinely good pop-psychology fun comes from essays on such topics as Dobby and self-mutilation; Lord Voldemort and antisocial personality disorders; the romantic attachment styles of Ron, Harry, and Hermione; and, yes, even Harry Potter therapy (step-by-step instruction on "learning to cast positive spells of thought instead of negative"). This book would be an innovative choice for educators looking to engage older students of literary criticism or theoretical psychology; it's a hit-or-miss indulgence for fans of the series.&#x2014;<i>Shannon Peterson, Kitsap Regional Library, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Interestingly enough, Mr. Stiltonoot&#x2019;s life is quite similar to that of his popular descendant&#x2019;s, except with mock-prehistoric trappings of the Flintstones variety. Stiltonoot&#x2019;s adventures are told in the tried-and-true format, i.e., ample colorful illustrations, diagrams, maps, words in the text frequently enlarged in a dizzying variety of fonts, and side blocks with bits of information and nonsense. Here Stiltonoot must overcome many perils to rescue the famous Stone of Fire stolen from the mouseum by the evil Tiger Khan. Literary references include Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes; however, the plot is more in the nature of Indiana Jones.

In this engaging new stand-alone work, he offers a full and warmly personal account of&nbsp;the play itself, explores its extraordinary impact throughout the history of western literature, and seeks to uncover the mystery at its heart.</p><p>Harold Bloom is a Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University and a former Charles Eliot Norton Professor at Harvard. As <i>The Paris Review</i> has pointed out, "no critic in the English language since Samuel Johnson has been more prolific." His more than thirty books include <i>The Best Poems of the English Language</i>, <i>The Art of Reading Poetry</i>, and <i>The Book of J</i>. He is a MacArthur Prize Fellow, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, including the Academy's Gold Medal for Belles Lettres and Criticism, the International Prize of Catalonia, and the Alfonso Reyes Prize of Mexico.<br><br>Alfred Kazin has said, "Bloom is all literature, (he) positively lives it," and <i>The New York Times</i> called him "the most original literary critic in America." He lives in New Haven and New York.The Prince of Denmark, argues the eminent Bloom, was not much loved by his father the warrior king or by his mother, Queen Gertrude. Developing themes from his Shakespeare: Invention of the Human, Bloom adds that Hamlet was instead rather detached, moving through life rather like the lead in his own personal drama, giving a theatrical flair to moments such as the death of Polonius and aptly choosing a play to "catch the conscience of the king." The closest thing he ever had to a parent was Yorick the Jester, and his confrontation with Yorick's skull followed shortly by his attending Ophelia's funeral dealt a serious double blow to his indifference. It was then that he moves grimly toward the climax and his own death. Bloom generates any number of provocative themes, such as Hamlet's notions about plays and acting as reflecting Shakespeare's own rivalries with Ben Jonson, and that the prince never loved Ophelia. Some of the chapters are really too short to do justice to their topics, raising more questions than answers. Nor is the last third of the book, on the play's place in our cultural heritage, up to the parts that focus on its contents, though it features fewer off-putting attacks on political correctness than Bloom's more polemical works. Still, this is not a tyro's book; Bloom makes no concessions to readers who lack a deep familiarity with the play. Nor is it for any reader with a thin skin about Bloom's assumptions about the Anglo-European literary legacy. Short, sophisticated and opinionated, this is a thorny goodie for Bardolators and Bloomians. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Liar Liar (Harriet Blue, 3)</h2><p><b>Detective Harriet Blue returns in her biggest thriller yet in the instant <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.

With an introduction by Steve Harvey and&nbsp;a foreword&nbsp;by David Foster.</p><p>"To the readers of this book you need to know that EW&amp;F is simply the greatest living group in my lifetime. No one put together lyrics to a melody like they did; no one put harmony to sound and rhythm like they did; no one added horns in the way that they did and no one, but no one messed with our minds about love and life like they did. . . . EARTH because they grow on you; WIND because it moves you in one loving direction and FIRE because they consume your heart in a single flame of love."&#x2014;Steve Harvey</p><p>With its dynamic horns, contrasting vocals, and vivid stage shows, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire was one of the most popular acts of the late twentieth century&#x2014;the band "that changed the sound of black pop" (<em>Rolling Stone</em>)&#x2014;and its music continues to inspire modern artists including Usher, Jay-Z, Cee-Lo Green, and Outkast. At last, the band&#x2019;s founder, Maurice White, shares the story of his success.</p><p>White reflects on the great blessings music has brought to his life and the struggles he&#x2019;s endured: his mother leaving him behind in Memphis when he was four; learning to play the drums with Booker T. Jones; moving to Chicago at eighteen and later Los Angeles after leaving the Ramsey Lewis Trio; forming EWF, only to have the original group fall apart; working with Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond; his diagnosis of Parkinson&#x2019;s; and his final public performance with the group at the 2006 Grammy Awards. Through it all, White credits his faith for his amazing success and guidance in overcoming his many challenges.</p><p><em>My Life with Earth Wind, and Fire</em> is an intimate, moving, and beautiful memoir from a man whose creativity and determination carried him to great success, and whose faith enabled him to savor every moment.</p></p><p><p>Earth, Wind &amp; Fire was one of the most popular and significant bands of the past century, celebrated alongside Chicago, the Commodores, Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, and Sly and the Family Stone. They transcended genres and fused diverse influences, from R&amp;B to pop to jazz and beyond, earning multiple Grammy Awards&#x2014;and most recently a Lifetime Achievement Award, shortly after the passing of the band&#x2019;s founder, Maurice White. </p><p>Although many of White&#x2019;s contemporaries and fans, including Quincy Jones, Questlove, and Diane Warren, felt a kinship with him through his music, he himself was an intensely private man. In this riveting account of his personal life and his massively popular band, he bares his soul. </p><p>Raised by a family friend, relentlessly teased by schoolmates, Maurice found refuge in music and in visits from God. By the time he was six, he was singing in a gospel choir. He came of age musically with close childhood friends and future legends Booker T. Jones and songwriter David Porter. Trained at the Chicago Conservatory of music, he later joined Chess Records, where he played drums for Etta James, Sonny Stitt, and countless others. With the Ramsey Lewis Trio he toured the world, honed his showmanship, and learned much about the music business, but after receiving what he believed to be a message from the Divine, he created Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. It was a band like no other&#x2014;sellout crowds were spellbound by their costumes, energetic movement, dynamic horns, floating pianos, spinning drum kits, and vanishing acts assisted by magician David Copperfield. The band&#x2019;s performances were no less forgettable than their perennial hits: &#x201c;Shining Star,&#x201d; &#x201c;Reasons,&#x201d; &#x201c;Got to Get You into My Life,&#x201d; &#x201c;September,&#x201d; &#x201c;Boogie Wonderland,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s Groove.&#x201d; Maurice also produced music for Deniece Williams, the Emotions, Neil Diamond, James Ingram, Barbra Streisand, and Jennifer Holliday.</p>Maurice White&#x2019;s story illuminates Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&#x2019;s position as a band essential to American culture, and offers an intimate look at his final days, from his diagnosis of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease to his faith, which helped him not only to cope, but also to savor every single moment. He dreamed that his band&#x2019;s music, a reflection of the ideals of the 1970s, would inspire peace and unity across racial lines. This compelling memoir shows how he achieved that and much more.<p>Maurice White (1941&#x2014;2016) worked in the music industry for more than forty years as a bandleader, songwriter, producer, and musician. He founded the legendary group Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and served as its main songwriter and record producer, and as its co&#x2014;lead singer. White won six Grammys and three NAACP Image Awards, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p></p><h2>Chess Strategy for Kids</h2><p>So you have learned how to play chess, studied tactics and know some basic endgames and openings.

How can we know?<br> <br>When we brought animals out of their natural habitats and into our homes, we formed a partnership with them. The original impetus may have been for protection, but I believe that even in the very first human interactions with a cave-pet, there was an element of joy. We hope their domestication has brought them more advantages than disadvantages. Because we are grateful for what our pets offer us, we want to reliably provide what they need. We are advocates for these silent family members.<br> <br>Nonetheless, they communicate with their language of wagging tails, purring, and head-butting. We&#x2019;d like to believe that our pets are at least as cheerful as they might be in the wild. In general we do not concern ourselves with the comfort level of wildlife. However, when I worked in wildlife rehabilitation, I was deeply concerned about this, particularly because the animals were under human care. I was certain that once returned to the wild, they would make their own way. While quantifying the contentedness of a wild animal is difficult, I assess the happiness of pets every day.<br> <br>Owners wonder if any animal can be satisfied living in an apartment, a small ranch house, a mansion, a farmhouse, or a high-rise. They might wonder if the pet that travels the world with my client Oprah Winfrey is happier than the pet living in a city apartment with my client Sondra, who works as a night nurse. Both pets seem content to me.<br> <br>Pets keep us grounded in the moment. Despite our busy schedules, the pace of a pet remains the same, and we must become part of that pace, if only for a brief part of our day. A fifteen-minute walk with your dog or a quiet moment with your cat is invaluable for both you and your animal.<br> <br>Pet owners understandably worry about myriad things: whether they provide too few or too many activities for their pets, whether they are feeding them the best food, if current vaccine schedules are safe, and if alternative treatments really work. Finding the right resources and correct answers is fraught with false claims and vested interests.<br> <br>In response to all of this, I urge pet owners to not overanalyze. <i>A pet should be a joy, not a job.</i><br> <br>It is simple. Your pet lives in a safe, secure existence with a loving person. At the same time, understanding the primal imperatives will satisfy the inner wildcat and make the outer housecat purr; it will nourish the inner wolf and allow the outer puppy to grow.<br> <br>I have noticed clients in my practice becoming more confident about their pet care decisions. They know that the Royal Treatment is not a plan that lavishes pets with unneeded pampering, but a sensible way to treat them. Giving your pet the Royal Treatment can ensure that he or she is not only happy but also wildly healthy. Once I&#x2019;ve shown you how to do that, the next steps are a walk in the park.</p><h2>The Absolute Value of Mike</h2><p>From the author of <i>Mockingbird</i>, a National Book Award winner! <br><br>Mike tries so hard to please his father, but the only language his dad seems to speak is calculus.

Not well documented in American history, over 100,000 pregnant, unwed young women traveled mostly by train to Kansas City &#x2013; known as the Adoption Hub of America &#x2013; in the early- to mid-1900s.They would live in one of several maternity facilities before giving birth, signing their babies over for adoption and returning home empty handed and heartbroken.One of these facilities was The Willows Maternity Sanitarium, known as the "Ritz" or "Waldorf" of the maternity hospitals. It truly was a Mansion on a Hill and one of the largest of such facilities in America, this is the incredible, true story of The Willows and the compassionate family, yet savvy business owners, who started and operated the seclusion "home" from 1905 until its closing in 1969. With over 35,000 girls passing through its doorway, tales abound of Willows' children questioning the "who" and "why" as they search for answers to their separation.

Once? Twice?<br><br>More times than you can count? You're not alone. Nearly half of all dieters quit within the first month. This dire statistic from a 2012 study reinforces the fact that <em>starting</em> a diet program is easy; <em>staying with it</em> is the hard part. Yet the only way a diet program is going to work for you is if you actually stick with it. Now what if a diet could anticipate what you are thinking as you progress from day to day?<br><br>What if a program could actually <em>address</em> your feelings, frustrations and questions <em>as</em> you feel them, and also provide success strategies at the very moment you need them most so you can stay on your program and reach your goal weight?<br><br>After more than <em>15 million</em> visits with patients at the Lindora weight-loss clinics in Southern California, the Lean for Life program is able to do just that using what we've learned from more than 750,000 people who have lost a combined 15 million pounds on our program in the past 40-plus years. We guide our patients on a day-by-day basis through four weeks of Rapid Weight Loss, easing them through the tough days and using the easier days to give them additional insights on what they need to know to succeed on the program to get lean and stay lean.<br><br>In just four weeks, our patients enjoy more than rapid weight loss; they get a blueprint to a leaner body, reduced stress levels, more balanced blood sugar levels and a new way of thinking all in a simple, accessible program. An internal data analysis of Lean for Life patients found that 79 percent kept weight off and 43 percent maintained medically significant weight loss for up to 15 years after completing their program. Compare this to the widely quoted statistic that 95 percent of dieters typically regain the weight they worked so hard to lose on conventional diets. On this program, people really do get Lean for Life.<br><br>MORE THAN 750,000 SUCCESS STORIES . . . AND COUNTING!<br><br>You could say that I (Cynthia) grew up in the "waist-management" business. My father, weight-loss pioneer Marshall Stamper, M.D., opened his first Lindora weight-loss clinic in 1971. Motivated by the loss of his mother, who had died of obesity-related complications, Dr. Stamper created a comprehensive, resultsoriented program that helped people lose weight rapidly and safely. At the foundation of the program were Dr. Stamper's Six Essentials, which taught people how to change their behavior and change their physiology, making it easier to maintain their new, healthier weight. Throughout this book, you'll discover more about the Six Essentials which remain a cornerstone of the program and how they can help you reach your weight-loss goals.<br><br>Decades ago, Dr. Stamper was convinced that if people lost weight and learned healthier thinking habits, they could reverse or prevent certain ailments and health conditions. At the time, people called it "woo-woo science." Today, it's common knowledge that being overweight is a factor in type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and more. Dr. Stamper and his program were light years ahead of their time.<br><br>Back when I was a teenager, I was Dr. Stamper's guinea pig. In order to help me lose a few pounds, he put me on his revolutionary Rapid Weight Loss plan. It went far beyond ordinary meal plans and included a blueprint to "leanify" not just my body, but also my stress levels, my way of thinking and my daily habits. It helped me get lean and stay lean not just for a few weeks or a couple of months as with most diets, but Lean for Life.<br><br>Over the past 40-plus years, this same program helped people ranging from Hollywood stars wanting to drop those last 5 pounds to others struggling to lose more than 500 pounds. We've helped people not only whittle their waistline but also get off their blood pressure, cholesterol, type 2 diabetes and pain medications. We've helped lifetime yo-yo dieters get off the weight-loss roller coaster and maintain their new lean weight for years. We've seen people transform their bodies and their lives. You'll meet many of these "Lean for Lifers" within the pages of this book, including:<br><br><strong>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Traci, </strong>who lost more than 300 pounds and has kept it off for more than 10 years<br><br><strong>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Kimberly, </strong>who shrank from a size 18 to a sleek size 6<br><br><strong>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Laura, </strong>who dropped 36 pounds and no longer has to take her cholesterol, blood pressure, or type 2 diabetes medicines<br><br><strong>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Javier, </strong>who went from a 52-inch waist to a 34-inch waist<br><br>So far, we have more than 750,000 success stories, and there's no stopping! Each year, 35,000 real-life, everyday people like Traci, Kimberly, Laura and Javier visit our 40-plus clinics located throughout Southern California for in-person appointments with our staff of healthcare professionals, which includes M.D.s and registered nurses. Since I joined forces with Dr. Stamper (affectionately known as "Daddy") in 1988, I've been trying to make it easier than ever for people everywhere not just those who live close enough to visit our clinics to lose weight with our program. As a result, people can now log on to our personalized, interactive web-based program for daily support anywhere, anytime. People everywhere can also track the calories and nutrient content of our nutritional products on top-selling diet apps like Lose It! Thousands of people have gotten lean thanks to our books and products, which are sold in pharmacies and other stores nationwide. And millions of people have access to our program through their membership with some of the nation's largest health insurance providers.<br><br>Finding new ways and new strategies to help as many people as possible become Lean for Life has been my number-one goal. That's why, in the mid-1990s, I distilled the basics of the Lean for Life program used in Lindora clinics in my first book, <em>Lean for Life Phase One: Weight Loss.</em> I wanted the book to be not only a daily support tool for our patients as they progressed through the program, but also a way to make the program available to the tens of thousands of people who couldn't visit our clinics in person and who wanted to lose weight at home . . . <em>but didn't want to do it on their own.</em> It worked, and more than a decade after its publication, that book was still ranked as one of the top-selling books on Amazon.com.<br><br>Since the original book was published, however, a growing body of weight-loss science has emerged. This exciting new research provides insights into ways to enhance the Lean for Life program and proves why this program is so effective, validating the foundation of the program that has already helped so many people reach their weight goals. More than a decade of new science, new breakthroughs, new strategies and new techniques convinced me it was time to refine the program and update the book.<br><br>That's where a box of cookies came into play.<br><br>HOW A BOX OF COOKIES INSPIRED THE NEW LEAN FOR LIFE<br><br>In 2012, one of our Lean for Life patients returned from a vacation in Paris with a gift for me a box of gourmet dark chocolate European tea biscuits. She told me they were incredibly delicious, and she couldn't wait to share them with me. I immediately buzzed our operations team and asked them to join me in the conference room. When they arrived, we broke open the box, peeled away the wrappers, and started munching assessing the flavors, the crunchiness of the delicate biscuits and the richness of the chocolate.<br><br>There we were, a team of weight-loss professionals, nibbling on a box of cookies at 10:30 in the morning. Any passerby would have thought we were a bunch of frauds. You may be wondering, why on Earth would someone who had finally reached her ideal lean weight after failing on so many other diets bring me the CEO of the nation's largest medically supervised weight-loss system a box of cookies? And why would I encourage my staff to indulge in a mid-morning cookie-fest? It's not as crazy as it seems.<br><br>This was no ordinary box of cookies.<br><br>They were Europe's number-one brand of gourmet diet foods, and not only were they just as delicious as promised, but they were also formulated based on groundbreaking findings from the world of brain and satiety science, incorporating special nutrients known to enhance satiety and reduce hunger without sacrificing taste. Basically, they were engineered to accelerate weight loss while allowing you to eat the foods you've come to love. To say that I was intrigued is an understatement. After all, my mission is to find ways to make it easier for you to become Lean for Life.<br><br>A SMARTER PLAN TO OUTSMART YOUR BIOLOGY<br><br>With a little investigating, I soon learned who was behind those delicious European diet cookies. R�ginald Allouche, M.D., is a diabetes and weight-loss specialist, one of the world's foremost nutrition experts and the founder of KOT, the top brand of gourmet diet foods in Europe. The KOT products including cr�pes, pizza, pancakes, cookies and even ice cream are sold in 2,200 pharmacies throughout Europe and are used by more than 700,000 dieters there.<br><br>I was thrilled when Dr. Allouche accepted my invitation to come to our Southern California headquarters to meet with me and Dr. Stamper, who remains my most trusted advisor. Charming and effervescent, Dr. Allouche entertained us as he detailed his groundbreaking scientific research. He gave us a fascinating explanation of the inner workings of the brain, body and gut and how they gang up in overweight people to make it almost impossible to lose weight. Then he shared how he has spent his career trying to reverse that and get the brain, body and gut to help you lose weight. I'll let Dr. Allouche take it from here.<br><br>After hearing Dr. Allouche talk about how he worked with his patients, Dr. Stamper felt an instant rapport with the French weight-loss innovator. The two of them shared a similar approach to caring for patients. Rather than viewing their patients as statistics or "the gall bladder in room 4," they viewed each patient as an individual, whose brain, body, environment, emotions and thought patterns contributed to their weight problems. And they both understood that in order to help patients lose the weight, they had to treat all of those factors.<br><br>The meeting was so successful that I eventually collaborated with Dr. Allouche in 2012 to incorporate his scientific findings about the brain, body and gut as well as a touch of the French joie de vivre into the Lean for Life program. The two of us spent months infusing the program with the latest science-based strategies to enhance its effectiveness and make it easier and more <em>d�licieux</em> than ever to follow. And together, we rewrote the book that had already helped so many people achieve their weight-loss goals. The end result?<br><br><em>The New Lean for Life!</em><br><br>WHAT'S NEW IN <strong><em>THE NEW LEAN FOR LIFE?</em></strong><br><br>In this book, we've streamlined the Lean for Life program, incorporating Dr. Allouche's own groundbreaking research, as well as that of others. Did you know that for your brain weight loss and satiety go hand in hand? In The New Lean for Life you'll become an expert in satiety science and understand why deprivation dieting is doomed to fail, and why allowing you to eat the lip-smacking foods you would end up consuming anyway is essential for long-term weight loss. Our new program includes up-to-the-minute findings from the world of science that show how your brain, body and gut make you a slave to the habits that can supersize you. Then we give you a plan to trick your brain, body and gut into helping you change your habits and get lean instead.<br><br>You'll get to know how your brain and body can actually "forget" how to eliminate the contents of your fat cells, which causes you to keep stockpiling more and more excess fat, and discover our plan to help your brain and body remember how to release the fat from your fat cells. And there's so much more.<br><br>Here's what <em>The New Lean for Life</em> can do for you:<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Help you shrink the size of your fat cells <em>twice as much as conventional diets!</em><br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Lose up to 20 pounds in 28 days.<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Allow you to enjoy more "forbidden" foods like cookies and pancakes and still lose weight.<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Reprogram your appetite so you won't feel hungry while losing weight.<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Rewire your brain so you can change the mindless everyday habits that are holding you back from reaching your weight goals.<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Heal your gut to calm cravings and improve satiety.<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Show you how to use "thought control" to fight the negative thoughts that sabotage your success.<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Curb cravings with our "Emergency Cravings Toolkit."<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Rev up metabolism with our "90-Second Fat-Burning Booster" exercise plan.<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;Begin reversing fat-promoting health conditions, such as insulin resistance and chronic inflammation <em>in just 2 weeks!</em><br><br>Of course, as with the original program, we'll continue to hold your hand through the process and help you manage daily obstacles so you can be successful not just for a month but for life!<br><br><em>Note: This is a powerful program. A ketogenic diet like Lean for Life is not recommended for type 1 insulin-dependent diabetics, pregnant or nursing mothers, or people with serious liver or kidney disease.

We encourage you to take the "A Message to Your Doctor" letter on page XX with you to your healthcare provider.</em><br><br>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br><br><em>The New Lean for Life</em> isn't a book you <em>read;</em> it is a book you do. It is intended to be a constant companion as you shrink your fat cells and shrink your body. Everything about the way this book is organized and presented is based on what we have found to be most helpful to our patients in their journey to rapid, lasting weight loss.<br><br>For example, in our experience, new dieters often feel overwhelmed by the "commitment" of reading several chapters of science before getting to the action plan that will help them begin losing weight. We've observed that our clinic patients don't want all that scientific information about <em>why</em> they're overweight all at once. They want to get started right away with <em>what to do</em> to get lean. That's why this book takes a completely different approach from what you may be used to. We call it the "drip method," and it simply means that we'll dole out new ideas and information about the overall program and the science behind it in small, bite-sized chunks that are easily digestible. Think of it as brain food!<br><br>Way more fun than Biology 101, chapter 1 features Dr. Allouche's look at how your brain, body and gut can conspire to transform what you eat into a "spare tire" or "muffin top."

Award-winning journalist Travis Sawchik takes you behind the scenes to expertly weave together the stories of the key figures who changed the way the Pirates played the game, revealing how a culture of collaboration and creativity flourished as whiz-kid analysts worked alongside graybeard coaches to revolutionize the sport and uncover groundbreaking insights for how to win more games without spending a dime. From pitch framing to on-field shifts, this entertaining and enlightening underdog story closely examines baseball&#x2019;s burgeoning big data movement and demonstrates how the millions of data points which aren&#x2019;t immediately visible to players and spectators, are the bit of magic that led the Pirates to finish the 2013 season in second place and brought an end to a twenty-year losing streak.</p></p><p>TRAVIS SAWCHIK covers the Pirates and Major League Baseball for the<i> Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</i>.

Taking cues from Michael Lewis's <i>Moneyball</i> and Jonah Keri's <i>The Extra 2%,</i> Sawchik wonderfully dissects statistics and the game itself in a style that will score with a broad range of readers.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Big Data Baseball, </i>Travis Sawchik reveals one of the great untold baseball stories of the early 21st century--how the Pittsburgh Pirates ended a twenty-year streak of futility by using data to revolutionize the way they positioned their defenders. Sawchik's fascinating tale is not merely about numbers, however. It also is about a spirit of collaboration between the new-age analysts and old-school field operatives that elevated the Pirates above other teams with access to the same information. For those who truly want to understand how the game has changed, <i>Big Data Baseball</i> is a must-read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ken Rosenthal, Senior MLB writer for FOXSports</i></p><p>&#x201c;An author's goal when telling a story like this is to combine gripping storytelling with fresh insight into the wonkish methods an underdog baseball team uses to defy odds and win. The former is a great achievement for anyone, let alone a first-time author. The latter, given how incredibly secretive sports teams have become, is damn near impossible. In <i>Big Data Baseball, </i>Travis Sawchik pulls both off, and he does so masterfully.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jonah Keri, author of The Extra 2% and writer for Grantland</i></p><p>&#x201c;I read and loved <i>Big Data Baseball...</i>Highly recommend if you dig baseball stats and anecdotes!&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Seth Meyers</i></p><p>&#x201c;At times, the story reads almost like a John R. Tunis baseball book for boys...Tunis' optimism, idealization of character, and overall enthusiasm all are here. Most important is Sawchik's realization, however, that the diamond will never again be so rough-data-gatherers and -analysts are polishing assiduously. Both a comprehensive and a focused look at how computer-recorded data are fundamentally altering America's pastime.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;The paradox is that as baseball becomes more complicated, the Pittsburgh Pirates are making it less complicated with one single word: communication.<i> Big Data Baseball </i>intelligently reveals how the symbiotic relationship between the data and the human factor is the future of baseball.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ron Darling, former major league pitcher and MLB Network and SNY analyst</i></p><p>&#x201c;Insightful, thorough, and outstanding. Travis takes us beyond the field to show where we are in the post-sabermetric revolution. The Pirates have combined scouting, analytics, and old fashioned attention to detail to revitalize their franchise. Want the state of the art in winning baseball? <i>Big Data Baseball</i> gives it to you.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Brian Kenny, analyst/anchor for MLB Network</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sawchik provides us with far more than the binary debate of &#x2018;stats versus scouts.' Rather, he's produced the definitive narrative of how one organization forged a way forward using both objective and subjective methods---and made a great, skeptical baseball city believe again.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jon Morosi, national baseball writer for Fox Sports</i></p><p>&#x201c;It's too simplistic to call this &#x2018;<i>Moneyball</i> 2.0,' but Sawchik has done much the same as what Michael Lewis did--he's found an interesting story about how a team is forced to do things differently. Much like the Pirates, Sawchik finds a way to not go with the herd, not take the simple approach, and to make us understand how Neal Huntington changed a culture. Sawchik's ability to find insights and the human stories inside of rows and columns on a spreadsheet is what makes <i>Big Data Baseball</i> a great read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Will Carroll, writer at BleacherReport.com and former writer for Sports Illustrated and BaseballProspectus.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Big Data Baseball </i>is the logical successor to <i>Moneyball,</i> a blueprint for how the successful teams of the next decade will get ahead. Sawchik has done a masterful job of pulling back the curtain to show how one team used advanced data analysis and technology to gain a competitive advantage. Serious fans will find the story fascinating and enlightening, and baseball executives who choose to ignore Sawchik's insights do so at their own peril.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sean Lahman, Database Coordinator for the Society of American Baseball Research and Data Reporter for Gannett Newspapers</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Big Data Baseball</i> takes readers inside the Pirates' analytics department, clubhouse, and beyond.

Just as a unique cast of players, coaches, analysts, and executives--Clint Hurdle, Neal Huntington, Dan Fox, Mike Fitzgerald, Russell Martin, Francisco Liriano, Ray Searage, Gerrit Cole, and more--were exactly the right people in the right place at the right time to put baseball's latest wave of statistics into practice, Sawchik is the right man to tell the story.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jay Jaffe, contributing writer to SportsIllustrated.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;The Pittsburgh Pirates were the story of the season in 2013, but Travis Sawchik set his reporting eye on something bigger: The story of the decade. He found it in Pittsburgh's use of big data, which is forcing teams and analysts to rethink a century of baseball wisdom. Sawchik is perfectly positioned to tell this story, with a backstage pass to the Pirates' season and the keen baseball mind necessary to illuminate a complex subject.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sam Miller, coeditor, Baseball Prospectus 2014</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Big Data Baseball</i> is a <i>Moneyball</i> story for a new era, one in which the people and numbers work in tandem, rather than against each other.

Travis Sawchik describes the Pirates' tactics in fascinating detail, noticing crucial bits of strategy most commentators miss and explaining how members of the Bucs' unglamorous roster formed a team far greater than the sum of its parts. In an era in which most clubs have already learned the lessons of <i>Moneyball, Big Data Baseball </i>is as close to a sequel as we're likely to get. As a Pirates fan, I can't recommend it highly enough, unless you're the GM of an opposing team, in which case I hope you'll stay far, far away.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Charlie Wilmoth, editor of BucsDugout.com and author of Dry Land: Winning After 20 Years at Sea with the Pittsburgh Pirates</i></p><p>&#x201c;Travis Sawchik paints a picture of the 2013 Pirates and their successful pursuit of a postseason berth: equal parts new-age data, front office decision-making, management's leadership ability, and on-field player success--all contributing to Pittsburgh ending a twenty-year losing streak.

But history has a way of repeating itself, and Kate now faces an ever-widening chasm between herself and her daughter. With Sabine about to make her own journey to Ireland to see the grandmother Kate abandoned, Kate is left wondering how they ever made it here, and what she can do to close the gap between them.&nbsp; </p><p>For Joy, seeing her granddaughter is a dream come true. After the painful separation from Kate, she&#x2019;s looking forward to having time with Sabine. Yet almost as soon as the young woman arrives, the lack of common ground between them deflates her enthusiasm. And when Sabine&#x2019;s impetuous, inquisitive nature forces Joy to face long-buried secrets from her past, she realizes that perhaps it&#x2019;s time to finally heal old wounds.</p><p><strong>&#x201c;This perceptive...novel does the mother-and-daughter thing in page-turning style.&#x201d;</strong><strong>--<em>Elle</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Jojo Moyes is a British novelist and journalist. She is one of only a few authors to have twice won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award by the Romantic Novelists' Association and has been translated into eleven different languages. </p>Touchy relationships among several generations of mothers and daughters mark this first novel by British journalist Moyes. Chapters alternate between the early days of Joy and Edward Ballayntyne's marriage in Hong Kong and their present-day struggles with London-based daughter Kate and granddaughter Sabine. At 15, Sabine despises her single mother, whose frequent change of boyfriends keeps their household in flux. While Kate irons out her latest man problem, she sends Sabine to live on the family estate in Ireland with her estranged parents, whose passion is horse breeding. Grandmother is coldly stern, and grandfather is ancient and bedridden. Their employee, Thom, teaches Sabine to ride horses, a pastime that thaws the teenager's sullenness. When Kate visits Ireland for the first time since she fled ten years earlier, she is amazed to find her daughter not only happily tending horses but also her difficult grandparents. But while things may be healing on the home front, Kate's romantic life is still turbulent: she encounters an old flame from her younger days on the estate, which reopens old wounds. The Irish setting and warmly described family relationships will appeal to fans of Maeve Binchy. Recommended. Carol J.

On January 22 and January 23, ZZ Top opened for the mighty Rolling Stones in Hawaii. Some believed that ZZ Top upstaged the Stones. David Blayney had been a roadie for the trio since 1969. He told Gary James of Classic Bands: &#34;...back in those days when no one had a clue as to who or what ZZ Top was, when they would go out and appear to an audience that was totally cold to them and maybe they&#39;d heard one or two songs on the radio...it blew their minds. It would catch them off guard. It was so strong coming from three pieces. It was like, how come I haven&#39;t heard of these guys? Where have they been? They would catch a lot of people by surprise.

When the Japanese entered the war in 1941, some 20,000 British civilians in the European colonies in Asia were rounded up and marched off to concentration camps where they were to remain for three long years. Over 3,000 of them were children. This is the first time their extraordinary experiences of suffering, endurance and bravery have been collected together. STOLEN CHILDHOODS offers a window to a forgotten era and explores what happened when that world was brutally and suddenly shattered. Living on what effectively became the frontline of a war, in daily contact with an enemy whose values were totally alien, they witnessed acts of shocking violence. Harrowing, but ultimately uplifting, internment from a child&#39;s perspective is a complex - and untold - story. It is a story that features horror, suffering and self-sacrifice, but also celebrates the resilience, adaptability and irrepressibility of the human spirit.</p><p>Nicola Tyrer is a freelance journalist who works for the DAILY MAIL and DAILY TELEGRAPH.

In the early 1800s he was a diplomat, a member of the court of Tsar Alexander III, and a member of the Imperial Academy<br> of Arts.<br><br> He was also a gourmet who loved to entertain guests by hosting dinner parties. One of the dishes he often&nbsp;served was made with saut�ed beef, onions, mushrooms, sour cream, and other condiments.

One night, more customers than normal came in to eat, and the restaurant kitchen ran out of the usual menu items. So Alex put together odds and ends&#x2014;eggs, romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and pepper. He made croutons out of some dried bread and then mixed&nbsp; everything together.<br><br> The customers loved it!<br><br> He named it aviator salad since the restaurant was near an airfield.

She complained that there was &#x201c;nothing new&#x201d; on the menu.<br>&nbsp;<br>The chef put together &#x201c;something new.&#x201d; Mrs. Benedict was pleased, so the chef named it eggs Benedict.<br><br>The second story: Samuel Benedict, a New York socialite, had had too much&nbsp; to&nbsp; drink one&nbsp; night in 1894. He went into the Waldorf-Astoria the next morning and ordered his &#x201c;perfect remedy for a hangover.&#x201d; It was such a great combination that the hotel&#x2019;s restaurant added it to the menu and named it eggs Benedict.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> <b>Graham Crackers <br></b> Sylvester Graham was a Presbyterian minister in Connecticut in the early 1800s. He was convinced that people were suffering from many bad habits, including poor diets.<br><br> He preached against tight clothing, soft mattresses, and alcohol. He thought pepper, mustard, and catsup caused insanity. He preached in favor of exercise, open bedroom windows, cold showers, and a vegetarian diet. He also recommended &#x201c;cheerfulness at meals.&#x201d;<br><br> Graham is probably most remembered for his belief that white bread was evil and people should eat &#x201c;un- bolted&#x201d; wheat flour (wheat flour from which the bran&nbsp; has not been removed). He urged women to stop buying bread from bakeries and instead to make their own.<br>This suggestion so infuriated professional bakers that a street fight once broke out in Boston after one of Graham&#x2019;s sermons.<br><br> But Graham had many followers.

Since their domestication high in the Andes, they have been farmed, smuggled, sacrificed, and sometimes kept around just to be petted. They have functioned at different times as luxury commodities, literary muses, and national symbols, and they have served by turns as beasts of burden, circus performers, and even golf caddies. In this book, Helen Cowie charts the fascinating history of llamas and their close relatives, alpacas, guanacos, and vicu�as.<br><br> Cowie illustrates how deeply the Incas venerated llamas and shows how the animals are still cherished in their native lands in Peru and Bolivia, remaining central to Andean culture. She also tells the story of attempts to introduce llamas and alpacas to Britain, the United States, and Australia, where they are used today for trekking, wool production, and even as therapy animals.<br> Packed with llama drama and alpaca facts, this book will delight animal lovers, fans of natural history, and anyone who just can&#x2019;t resist these inimitable animals&#x2019; off-the-charts cuteness factor.</p><p><b>Helen Cowie </b>is a lecturer in history at the University of York. She is the author of <i>Conquering Nature in Spain and Its Empire, 1750&#x2013;1850</i> and <i>Exhibiting Animals in Nineteenth-Century Britain</i>.<br> &nbsp;"<i>Llama</i> beautifully weaves together the anthrozoology and cultural history of four South American camelids&#x2014;the domesticated llamas and alpacas and their respective wild counterparts, the guanacos and vicu�as&#x2014;with their biology and evolution. From the use of camelids by indigenous peoples for wool, meat, and transport to these animals&#x2019; modern-day participation as golf caddies, therapy animals, and wedding-day mascots in the United States, the narrative Cowie tells is at once sweeping and studded with compelling scholarly details." (Barbara J. King <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"Cowie's <i>Llama</i> is a very useful case study of the mania exhibited by Europeans and Euro- Americans and Oceanians for acclimatization projects, many of which have entailed unintended consequences. But llamas have been fairly benign as introduced species go. Wool is the main attraction, and still at a premium. But llamas, good-natured on the whole, can also be used as petting-zoo and therapy animals. And they are excellent in the role of guards. They can't do much to intruders except spit on them, but they are large enough to scare away coyotes and foxes, and their spit is nothing to be trifled with." (Tim Morris <i>lection</i>)</p><h2>Watchers Out of Time and Others</h2><p>From the front flap of this 405 page book: &#34;The story themes set forth by H.P. Lovecraft and developed by August Derleth, have been collected into one omnibus of post-mortem collaborations belonging virtually to every period of Lovecraft&#39;s work. The tales follow a common pattern. A lineal descendent of the Whateleys, the Marshes, or the Bishops - or a similarly molded character of problematical nature - settles among the rugged hills and dark forests of his New England ancestry or in the neighborhood of a deteriorated coastal town. Occasionally, a nocturnal habitue of the byways and alleys of the Rhode Island capital succeeds the customary figure. Ancient rites and black magic still abet the forces of evil. The vestigial aura of malignancy pervading the landscape and the concomitant pipping of the frogs and whippoorwills give substance to the strange half-whispered tales among the old families. Inevitably the protagonist&#39;s curiosity and subsequent investigations prove his downfall - but, fortunately, not before the hasty scrawls of the perennial manuscript have produced those pleasant nostalgic shudders. The resemblances, the, are obvious. But Derleth, cleverly and entertainingly, maintains interest and suspense, rearranging with novel twists and varying distortion the fundamental elements. For devotees of the Gothic tradition, this collection is a feast of good reading, incurring a debt of gratitude to August Derleth for preserving the essence of that eldritch world created by H.P. Lovecraft.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Herbal Teas for Health and Healing</h2><p>Herbal teas have their own characteristic virtues. Some are slightly stimulating, others are soothing and induce quiet sleep or act as tranquilizers. Many are tonics that can bring an "out-of-gear" system back to complete health.

His short-story collection <b>Banished Misfortune</b> won two Hennessy Awards and the Tom Gallon Award. His novels include <b>Fighting with Shadows</b> and <b>A Goat's Song</b>. He is a member of Asodana, the academy of distinguished Irish writers. He lives in Sligo, Ireland.Eschewing straightforward chronicle, Irish poet and novelist Healy (A Goat's Song, 1995), born in 1947, re-creates his upbringing through a series of impressionistic word-pictures and characterizationsmost poignantly of his father, a policeman who retired early due to ill health. Writes Healy, taking his bearings here, ``What happened is a wonder, though memory is always incomplete, like a map with places missing.'' The young boy felt trapped with his family's move from the small village of Finea to the town of Cavan, where they lived above the busy bakery-tearoom operated by his aunt Maisie and his mother, Winnie. He and his father were both sleepwalkers, seeking escape in night dreams (``most nights we set off for Finea''). Healy gives little description of how he grew to be a man in London, though he does allow a self-deprecating glimpse ahead to the writer who returns home to find himself fabricating, to the editor of the local paper, a literary success he's not yet achieved. Thematically and stylistically, Healy's talents are ever on display here; the occasional sustained heroic catalogue of Cavan, for examplethe author piling clause upon vivid clause, like so many layers of frostingproviding technical tours-de-force; though his later experience at Saint Patrick's Secondary College, rendered primarily through re-created diary entries, is far less memorable. In closing as he flash-forwards to the 1990s and his return to Cavan to care for his aged mother, infirm and losing her faculties, Healy evokes the surprising bawdiness of the old woman's humor and ruminates on an imaginary place, Hy Brazil, like another Atlantis rising out of the sea, out beyond where the author lives, in North Sligo. The island, he concludes, is, like life, ``peopled with uncertainties.'' With his descriptive talent and his knack for making comedy out of tragedy, Healy has written a beautiful, imaginative, full- blooded memoir. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Featuring DI Marjory Fleming - &#39;Big Marge&#39; - and set in Galloway. If you enjoy novels by Ann Cleeves, Faith Martin, Val McDermid and LJ Ross, try Lamb to the Slaughter.&#39;The crime czar of the Scottish small town!&#39; Val McDermidA sunny evening, a tranquil garden - and an old man brutally gunned down on his doorstep. In the pretty and tranquil market town of Kirkluce, a proposed superstore development has divided the population in an increasingly bitter war. The low-level aggression of bored youth that is generally tolerated has become sinister. The bloodied carcass of a sheep abandoned in the streets is more than just unpleasant vandalism and teenage bikers, terrorising a woman to breaking point, are impossible to control. When a second victim is killed in what seems a random shooting, the fear in the town becomes tangible. DI Fleming will not accept that the crimes are motiveless, but she struggles to make sense of the two murders, when nothing makes sense any more and no one will believe anything. Not even the truth.Reader reviews:&#39;Once again a roller coaster of a ride to the truth. Her knack of keeping you thinking is outstanding&#39;&#39;This is a brilliant read, enhanced by the personalities of the characters&#39;&#39;DI Fleming is such a great character, each book is a joy to read &#39;</p><p><p>Aline Templeton is the author of the DI Marjory Fleming series as well as several other mystery novels, including <i>Night and Silence</i> and <i>Shades of Death</i>.</p>The fourth in Templeton's series to feature Scottish Det. Insp. Marjory Fleming (<i>Cold in the Earth</i>, etc.) finds Fleming's quiet community of Kirkluce divided by a plan to open a superstore that threatens local trade. Soon after Col. Andrew Carmichael, the owner of property essential to the developer's proposal, receives a fatal shotgun blast to the chest, someone shoots young rowdy Barney Kyle in the back as he's riding his bike. While the motive for killing Kyle appears different, Fleming and her team find some suggestive links between the two victims. Templeton does a nice job of conveying the details of smalltown life, though her characters and their motivations are less well developed than those of such better-known writers as Ruth Rendell and Minette Walters. Toward the end, the author throws in enough twists to distinguish this from many similar contemporary British police procedurals. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in Santa Barbara.</p>Routine by-the-numbers legal procedural by one of the better craftsmen of the genre. Freedman (Key Witness, 1997, etc.) applies his formula - burned-out legal eagle takes a case that no one else wants - to the luxurious California suburb of Montecito, where bubbly 14-year-old Emma Lancaster is snatched out of her bedroom by a mysterious intruder. Her father, Doug, the somewhat boorish owner of local television stations, and her slightly ditsy society mom, Glenna, are horrified - especially when Emma's rotting corpse appears in a nearby stream. The cops are mystified until the dead girl - s key chain turns up in the backseat of a Porsche belonging to Joe Allison, a womanizing local newscaster who works at one of Doug's TV stations. Only circumstantial evidence ties Allison to the crime, until the girl's friends reveal that Emma was pregnant when murdered and that Allison is the likely father. With everyone in southern California screaming for Allison's head, Luke Garrison, a former crusading Santa Barbara district attorney who lost his career to the guilt he suffered after he got an innocent man executed, reluctantly agrees to defend Allison. Garrison, with the help of Riva Montoya, his spunky girlfriend (and former drug-dealer - s moll), comes to believe that Allison just might have been framed, especially when the ex-D.A. himself begins receiving mysterious death threats. It's no surprise when Garrison rallies and successfully acquits his client. Freedman's contrived plotting, so easily forgiven in his better books, seems trite here, as the villain conveniently unhinges, stalking Garrison with a high-powered rifle, and leaving pistol-packing Riva the chance to save the day. Still, despite a jocular, clichd narrative in which ``news . . . spreads like wildfire,'' and more than one character ``goes ballistic, - Freedman on an average day is usually better than most.

His lectures, writings, letters, and poems are published as The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. He felt it was best to teach universal principles rather than personalities, so we find little mention of Ramakrishna in the Complete Works. Swami Vivekananda represented Hinduism at the first World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 where he was an instant success. Subsequently he was invited to speak all over America and Europe. He was a man with a great spiritual presence and tremendous intellect. Most of the Vedanta Societies which were founded in America and Europe up through the 1930s can trace their origins directly to Vivekananda or the people who heard him speak from 1893 through 1900.</p><h2>Marxism, Orientalism, Cosmopolitanism</h2><p><p>"One of the best analysts of the contemporary Arab world." <i>Le Monde</i></p><p>In this collection of essays, Gilbert Achcar examines the controversial relationship of Marxism to religion, to Orientalism and its critique by Edward Said, and to the concept of cosmopolitanism.<br><br>A compelling range of issues is discussed within these pages, including a comparative assessment of Christian liberation theology and Islamic fundamentalism; Orientalism in reverse&#x201d;, which can take the form of an apology for Islamic fundamentalism; the evolution of Marx&#x2019;s appraisal of non-Western societies; and the vagaries of cosmopolitanism&#x201d; up to our present era of globalisation.<br><br>Erudite and incisive, these essays provide a major contribution to the critical discussion of Marxism, Orientalism and cosmopolitanism, and illuminate the relationships between all three.</p><p><b>Gilbert Achcar</b> is a professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.

The first line was the Standard Swatch and one that Swatch triumphantly claimed was a watch for both sexes and all nations. The success it had was unprecedented and led to further designs and newer developments, each sharing the criteria of being both affordable, and fun. There are now over fifteen lines of Swatch, each with functions that make them unique. For example, the Art models have all been designed by leading contemporary designers; the Scuba 200 is water-resistant to depths of 660 feet; and the Swatch Access can be programmed to allow electronic entry to large events such as the Olympics. Written by a true enthusiast and expert in the world of watches, Swatch: A Guide for Connoisseurs and Collectors offers a perfect overview of the types of Swatch available and the amazing designs that have emerged over the years. There is advice on collecting, and clubs that can be joined, as well as a directory of over 300 fantastic examples of this fun phenomenon.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Ancient Wisdom and Modern Science</h2><p>Recent advances in a variety of scientific disciplines have revealed the limitations of the Newtonian-Cartesian model of the universe.

As a boy he attended the Jesuit college at Darjeeling, and he was later sent to St Edmund&#39;s School, Canterbury. His first authentic literary work was The Black Book, which appeared in Paris in 1938 under the aegis of Henry Miller and Anais Nin. &#39;In the writing of it I first heard the sound of my own voice... &#39; he later wrote. The novel was praised by T.S. Eliot, who published his first collection of poems A Private Country in 1943. The first of the island books, Prospero&#39;s Cell, a guide to Corfu, appeared in 1945. It was followed by Reflections on a Marine Venus, about Rhodes. Bitter Lemons, his account of life in Cyprus, won the Duff Cooper Memorial Prize in 1957. Subsequently he drew his years in Greece for The Greek Islands. Durrell&#39;s wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece The Alexandria Quartet (Justine, Balthazar, Mountolive and Clea) which he completed in southern France, where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the Quartet and The Avignon Quintet (Monsieur, Livia, Constance, Sebastian and Quinx), he wrote the two-decker Tunc and Nunquam, now united as The Revolt of Aphrodite. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writings (Spirit of the Place), Collected Poems, a thriller, White Eagles Over Serbia, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. His correspondence with lifelong friend Henry Miller has also been published. Caesar&#39;s Vast Ghost, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, appeared a few days before his death at home in Sommieres in 1990.How the diplomatic corps of the British Foreign Serviceas portrayed in the loosely connected sketches collected in this omnibus volumemanaged to survive until now is one of those mysteries before which the mind boggles. Featuring amiable, deadpan loopy Antrobus as narrator and prototype ("we dips," he says in all innocence of himself and his colleagues), these tales of comic woe, small disasters, goofs, gaffes and misadventures from the ridiculous to the absurd depict the vaudeville of a government bureaucracy. How, for example, the dips could bring themselves to accept an invitation from the Kurdish Embassy to a circumcision (smelling salts, stiff upper lip, stiff drink and sheer courage) is still not fully clear. Durrell's aim is to amuse while he instructs, and he succeeds with unfailing good humor. Pieces from this collection appeared over the years in American magazines, but the individual volumes have never been published here. Illustrations.

When one fully understands these implications, Fumerton argues, one will see philosophical usefulness of a foundationalism relying on acquaintance. Contending that the externalist response to skepticism is too quick and easy, Fumerton defends a version of internalism, but in doing so puts into stark relief the radically different alternatives for dealing with skepticism that our metaepistemological views force upon us.</p><p><b>Richard A. Fumerton</b> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Iowa. He is the author of <i>Metaphysical and Epistemological Problems of Perception</i> and <i>Reason and Morality: A Defense of the Egocentric Perspective</i>I know of no other discussion of skepticism and its relation to the externalist/internalist debate that is as powerful and subtle as Fumerton's. (Richard Foley)<br><br><i>Metaepistemology and Skepticism</i> offers both a powerful defense of skepticism and a highly sophisticated and detailed tour through contemporary epistemology. Anyone interested in these matters will profit from a careful study of this fine book. (Jonathan Dancy, University of Reading)<br><br>. . . a very insightful and dialectically sophisticated piece of work that sheds a great deal of light on recent epistemological controversies and their relation to skepticism. I have learned a great deal from reading this book and expect to return to it often.

While working in Rosebower, a rural New York town founded by Spiritualists, Faye is surrounded by people who talk to the dead on a regular basis. So when influential Spiritualist Tilda Armistead invites Faye and her daughter to commune with the dead, she can't say no. An hour after Tilda's crystal ball shows Faye things no rational mind can explain, Tilda is dead. The evidence says someone trapped Tilda in a small room, nailing its one door shut before setting her house afire. There is no possible way for her to have escaped the blaze, let alone drive for miles before finding Faye and dying in her arms. Yet Tilda did. How? And why?</p><p>Anywhere else, these people would be dismissed as crazy. But in Rosebower, "normal" is relative.

The author, L.W. Sutherland, was an officer in No. 1 Squadron of the AFC, piloting a succession of aircraft - SE5s, RE8s, DH6&#x2019;s, Nieuport Scouts and Bristol Fighters - through the desert skies. Sutherland&#x2019;s down to earth memoir certainly succeeds in conveying the rough, tough Aussie humour with which he and his comrades confronted the hardships around them. But he never lets the reader forget that war is always a grim business, as the title of one of his last chapters on the final Tukish rout -&#x2019;Nine Miles of Dead&#x2019; cogently conveys. Among other curiosities the book also cointains one interesting and admiring chapter on T.E. Lawrence and his controversial contribution to the campaign. For Sutherland at least, who often acted as a courier and air chauffeur to Lawrence&#x2019;s irregulars, TEL remains an unstained hero. The book is illustrated with some fine photos of planes, pilots and Arab fighters.</p><p></p><h2>Priests of Mars (Warhammer 40,000)</h2><p>A new book from Graham McNeill on the mechanicum of Mars<br><br>An Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator fleet ventures beyond the borders of the Imperium, in pursuit of arcane technology.

Careful, meditative and painstaking exegesis brings a potential liability, that of losing the vitality, which must accompany exposition.</p><p>The Puritans called it 'that certain unction', Martyn Lloyd-Jones called it 'an access of power', others have called it 'the anointing'. If you desire that your preaching be lifted up to a position in which you are being used by the Spirit as a channel, then Arturo Azurdia can help you.</p><p>The insights in this book are gained from Art's careful study and practical experiences of being used by the Holy Spirit in his ministry. </p></p><p>Arturo G. Azurdia III is Senior Minister of Word and Worship at Trinity Church in Portland, Oregon. He is also Associate Professor of Pastoral and Church Ministry at Western Seminary and Founder and Director of The Spurgeon Fellowship."The goal of the book is to present a biblical theology of Spirit empowered preaching and it succeeds very well...reminded of much, challenged, rebuked, convicted (having frequently to turn aside to prayer), humbled, encouraged, and stirred up with a renewed desire to go at it again! My heart has truly been stirred." ~ <b>Ray Van Neste</b> (Director, R. C. Ryan Center for Biblical Studies, Union University, Jackson, Tennessee)<br> <br> "When you finish reading this book not only will you have a better idea of the role of the Spirit in preaching, but you will also know better how to preach in dependence on the Holy Spirit. Everyone who is preaching, or preparing to preach, needs to read this book" ~ <b>Joseph A. Pipa, Jr.</b> (President, Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Greenville, South Carolina)<br> <br> "Seldom does a book arise of which one can say, "This should be essential reading for preachers at whatever stage of their ministry!" But I can say this honestly of this book. . . It has made me wish that I could start all over again." ~ <b>Derek Prime</b> (Author and former pastor of Charlotte Chapel, Edinburgh)<br> <br> "Arturo Azurdia believes that much modern preaching is powerless.

Now, in <i>Nomad, </i>Hirsi Ali tells of coming to America to build a new life, an ocean away from the death threats made to her by European Islamists, the strife she witnessed, and the inner conflict she suffered. It is the story of her physical journey to freedom and, more crucially, her emotional journey to freedom&#x2014;her transition from a tribal mind-set that restricts women&#x2019;s every thought and action to a life as a free and equal citizen in an open society. Through stories of the challenges she has faced, she shows the difficulty of reconciling the contradictions of Islam with Western values. </p><p>In these pages Hirsi Ali recounts the many turns her life took after she broke with her family, and how she struggled to throw off restrictive superstitions and misconceptions that initially hobbled her ability to assimilate into Western society. She writes movingly of her reconciliation, on his deathbed, with her devout father, who had disowned her when she renounced Islam after 9/11, as well as with her mother and cousins in Somalia and in Europe. </p><p><i>Nomad </i>is a portrait of a family torn apart by the clash of civilizations. But it is also a touching, uplifting, and often funny account of one woman&#x2019;s discovery of today&#x2019;s America. While Hirsi Ali loves much of what she encounters, she fears we are repeating the European mistake of underestimating radical Islam. She calls on key institutions of the West&#x2014;including universities, the feminist movement, and the Christian churches&#x2014;to enact specific, innovative remedies that would help other Muslim immigrants to overcome the challenges she has experienced and to resist the fatal allure of fundamentalism and terrorism. </p><p>This is Hirsi Ali&#x2019;s intellectual coming-of-age, a memoir that conveys her philosophy as well as her experiences, and that also conveys an urgent message and mission&#x2014;to inform the West of the extent of the threat from Islam, both from outside and from within our open societies. A celebration of free speech and democracy, <i>Nomad </i>is an important contribution to the history of ideas, but above all a rousing call to action.</p></p><p><b>Ayaan Hirsi Ali</b> was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, was raised Muslim, and spent her childhood and young adulthood in Africa and Saudi Arabia. In 1992, Hirsi Ali came to the Netherlands as a refugee. She earned her college degree in political science and worked for the Dutch Labor party. She denounced Islam after the September 11 terrorist attacks and now serves as a Dutch parliamentarian, fighting for the rights of Muslim women in Europe, the enlightenment of Islam, and security in the West.<b>Chapter 1<br>My Father</b><br><br>When I walked into the Intensive Care Unit of the Royal London Hospital to see my father, I feared I might have come too late. He was sprawled across the hospital bed, his mouth eerily agape, and the machines that were attached to him were many and menacing. They beeped and ticked, and the lines that rapidly rose and fell on their monitors all seemed to be indicating a rapid countdown to his death.<br><br>"<i>Abeh</i>," I yelled at the top of my voice. "<i>Abeh</i>, it's me, Ayaan."<br><br>I squeezed his hand and anxiously kissed his forehead, and my father's eyes flew open. He smiled, and the warmth of his gaze and his smile radiated through the whole room. I put my palms over his right hand and he squeezed them and tried to speak, to force out at least a word or two. But he could only wheeze and gasp for breath. He strained to sit up, but he couldn't lift his body.<br><br>He was covered with white sheets, and it looked as if he were tied to the bed. Bald, he looked much smaller than I remembered. There was a terrible tube in his throat that was giving him oxygen through a ventilator; another led from his kidney to a dialysis machine, and yet another mess of tubes went into his wrist. I sat beside him and stroked his face and told him, "Abeh, Abeh, it's all right. Abeh, my poor Abeh, you're so sick."<br><br>He couldn't answer. Trying to speak, he would fall back, his chest pumping, and the machine that gave him oxygen would hiss and gasp for more air. Then, after resting for a moment or two, he would try again. He indicated with his right hand that he wanted a pen to write with, but he could hardly hold it; his muscles were too weak and he made only scratches on the paper. He was struggling so hard to hold the pen that he began sliding off the bed.<br><br>The ward was large, and nurses were bustling about changing sheets and giving medication. I noticed that the doctor had an accent and for a moment thought that he was from Mexico. When I asked where he came from he told me that he was from Spain. The ward was run almost entirely by immigrants. I could not tell the nurses from the doctors, and as I looked around I tried to guess the origins of the members of the medical team, technicians, and cleaners: the Indian Peninsula, blacks who I thought were from East or West Africa, people who looked North African, a few women with headscarves over their medical uniforms. If there were any Somali employees in the ward I did not see them, and fortunately they did not see me.<br><br>One of the nurses unrolled a plastic smock, tied it around her waist, and asked me to step aside, but my father would not let go of me and I had to pry his fingers from around my hand. The nurse propped him up higher with pillows, staring at me oddly. One of the nurses told me that she had read an article about me in a magazine, so some of them knew who I was. I glanced away and noticed the chart on his bed; it listed my father as Hirsi Magan Abdirahman, although his name is Hirsi Magan Isse.<br><br>A young doctor told me that my father had leukemia. He could have lived another year had he not caught an infection, which had become septic. Now, although he was out of the coma that he had fallen into a few days earlier, only the machines were keeping him alive. I asked again and again if my father was in pain, but the doctor said no, he was uncomfortable, but there was no pain.<br><br>I asked the doctor if I could take a picture with my father. He refused. He said we needed to ask the permission of the patient, and the patient was not in any state to make that decision.<br>In 1992, when I left him in Nairobi, my father was a strong, vital man. He could be fierce, even frightening - a lion, a leader of men. When I was growing up he was my lord, my hero, someone whose absence was mysterious, whose presence I longed for, whose approval meant everything and whose wrath I feared.<br><br>Now so many disputes lay between us. I had offended him deeply in 1992 by running away from a Somali man he had chosen for me to marry. He had forgiven me for that; we had spoken together, stiffly, on the phone. A decade later I offended him again, when I declared myself an unbeliever and openly criticized Islam's treatment of women. Our last, and worst, conflict was after I made a film about the abuse and oppression of Muslim women, <i>Submission</i>, with Theo van Gogh in 2004. After that my father simply would not answer the phone; he would not talk to me. Sometime after Theo was killed, when I had to go into hiding and my phone was taken away from me, I stopped trying to call him. When people asked, I could say only that we were estranged.<br><br>I learned he was sick in June 2008, only a few weeks before his death. I had received a message from Marco, my ex-boyfriend in Holland, saying that my cousin Magool in England was looking for me urgently. Magool is not close to my father's family, but she is resourceful. When my half sister, Sahra, realized how sick my father was, she asked Magool to try to track me down, and Magool called Marco, the only person she knew to whom I had been close when she and I had last spoken, five years earlier.<br><br>I phoned my father at his apartment in a housing development in the East End of London. It was late in the evening where he was, a bright sunny afternoon on the East Coast of America where I was. I was shaking. When he came to the phone he sounded just like himself, strong and excited. At the sound of his voice I felt tears welling in my eyes and I said the only thing I wanted to convey, that I loved him, and I heard his smile, so powerful it seemed to come through the telephone.<br><br>"Of course you love me!" he burst out loudly. "And of course I love you! Haven't you seen how parents cuddle and connect with their children? Haven't you been out in nature where you see how animals pet and lick their young? Of course I love you. You are my child."<br><br>I told my father how much I wanted to see him, but I explained that it might be difficult to arrange security for a visit to his apartment, which is a mostly immigrant area and overwhelmingly Muslim. To visit such a place without protection would be like a very small insect risking a flight through a roomful of huge spiders' webs; the little bug might get through unnoticed, but if it gets caught the consequences are clear. On the other hand, if I went there <i>with</i> police, that would be bound to cause ill feeling, as if I could not trust my own family.<br><br>"Security!" my father cried. "What do you need security for? Allah will protect you against anyone who wants to harm you! No one in our community will lay a finger on you. And besides, our family has never had a reputation for being cowardly! In fact the other day one of our most prominent clan members said that he wanted to debate with you. If you want, I can ask them to put together a delegation and take you to Jeddah, so you can debate him in Saudi Arabia! Why don't you arrange a press conference and say that you are no longer an unbeliever? Tell them that you have returned to Islam and from now on you're a businesswoman!"<br><br>I laughed quietly at my father, and for a while I just enjoyed listening to him talk. Then I asked after his health. He said, "You must remember, Ayaan, that our health and our lives are in the hands of Allah. I am on my way to the hereafter. My dear child, what I want you to do is read just one chapter of the Quran. <i>Laa-uqsim Bi-yawmiil-qiyaama</i>."<br><br>He recited - in Arabic, of course, though we were speaking Somali - a chapter called "The Resurrection": "I do call to witness the resurrection day; and I do call to witness the self-reproaching spirit; Does man think that we cannot assemble his bones? Nay, we are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers. But man wishes to do wrong in the time in front of him; he questions, when is the day of resurrection?"<br><br>I told my father that I would not lie to him, and that I no longer believed in the example of the Prophet. He cut me off, and his tone became passionate, impatient, then retributive. He read me more verses of the Quran, translating them into Somali, and he listed many examples of people like me, who had left Islam but had come back to the faith. He talked about hordes of non-Muslims converting to Islam across the globe, and he told me about the one true god; he warned me not to risk my hereafter.<br><br>As I listened to him I told myself that this magisterial lecture was from a father expressing his love in the only way he knew. I wanted to believe that the very fact that he was lecturing me meant that, in some deeper sense, he had begun to forgive me for the person I had become. Possibly, however, it was not that. Possibly he was only doing his duty. Living as a Western woman meant I had shed my honor; I wore Western clothes, which to him was no better than if I walked around wearing no clothes at all. Worst of all, I had abjured Islam and written a book with the brazen, triumphant title <i>Infidel</i> to proclaim my apostasy. But my father knew that his life was coming to an end, and he wanted to make sure that all his children, despite their errors, were safe on a path to heaven.<br><br>I let him talk. I didn't make false promises to convert. If I had, that might have helped him leave in peace, but I couldn't do it, I couldn't lie to him about that. I managed to tell him gently that although I no longer agreed with Islam, I would read the Quran. I did not add that, every time I reread it, I became more critical of its messages.<br><br>He broke into a series of supplications: "May Allah protect you, may He bring you back to the straight path, may He take you to Heaven in the hereafter, may Allah bless you and keep you healthy." And at the end of every supplication I responded with the required formula: "<i>Amin</i>," May it be so.<br><br>After a little while I told my father I had a flight to catch. He didn't ask where to, or why; I could tell that the details of terrestrial matters had little bearing for him now. Then I hung up, with so many more things left unsaid between us, and I almost missed the plane that was taking me to a conference in Brazil on multiculturalism.<br>At the end of June, after the conference in Brazil, I was scheduled to go to Australia for a colloquium on the Enlightenment. I planned to visit my father in London at the end of the summer. But in mid-August, on my way back from Australia, during a stopover in Los Angeles, I received another phone call from Marco. My father was in a coma.<br><br>I called my cousin Magool again, and she gave me the cell phone number of my half sister, Sahra. The last time I'd seen my father's youngest child, in 1992, Sahra was eight or nine years old, a wiry, energetic little kid. I had met her when stopping off in Ethiopia en route from my home in Kenya to Germany. From there, on my father's orders, I was supposed to go on to Canada, to join a man I barely knew, who was a distant cousin and who had become my husband. In those days Sahra lived in Addis Ababa with her mother, who, like my own mother, was still married to my father in spite of his absence. I had played with this little half sister of mine all afternoon, struggling to remember my childhood Amharic, which was the only language Sahra spoke back then and which I too had spoken when I was her age and still lived with my father.<br><br>Now, in the summer of 2008, Sahra was twenty-four. She was married and had her own four-month-old daughter. She lived with her mother, my father's third wife.<br><br>I didn't tell Sahra that I planned to visit our father in the hospital. It's a hideous thing to write, but I didn't really know if I could trust her with that information. I assume the closest members of my family don't actually want to kill me, but the truth is that I have shamed and hurt them; they have to deal with the outrage that my public statements cause, and undoubtedly some members of my clan do want to kill me for that.<br><br>Sahra volunteered the suggestion that if I did go to see Abeh, I should avoid visiting hours, when floods of Somalis would be going to the Royal London Hospital to seek a blessing from my father in order to improve their own chances of getting into heaven. For many, Abeh was a symbol of the battle against President Siad Barre's military regime, a man who had dedicated most of his adult life to overthrowing that regime. It would be the same in the East End of London as it was in Somalia: the many wives, the many children and grandchildren, the elders of the clan and the subclan and the brother subclans, scores and scores of relatives would come to my father to pay their respects. For many of those people I would not be welcome at my father's bedside because I was an unbeliever, an infidel, an avowed atheist, a filthy runaway, and worst of all, a traitor to the clan and to the faith. Some of them would certainly feel that I deserve to die, and to many more my presence would defile my father's deathbed and perhaps even cost him his place in the hereafter.<br><br>I felt no such rejection from Sahra, however. She was sweet and hushed, a little conspiratorial, as if by talking with her on the phone I had enrolled her in something clandestine and dangerous.<br><br>* * *<br><br>I needed to fly to London right away. Because this was an urgent, unplanned, purely personal trip, arranging security was going to be complicated, unlike attending a conference, for which everything is officially coordinated with the police weeks ahead of time. I knew it wouldn't be wise just to go, accompanied by the gentlemen who usually protect me in America. In Britain these men would not know their way around and would not be allowed to carry weapons. If I were rash in my planning I might put others as well as myself in danger.<br><br>I phoned a number of friends in Europe who I thought might be influential and asked them to try to help me arrange the protection I needed to make the trip. They spent many hours trying to help me, seemingly without success. One friend was told by a British official that as I was born in Somalia I should ask the Somali Embassy for help; they could approach the Foreign Office to seek security assistance for me. This absurd bureaucratic logic might have been comical in some circumstances, but not in the face of my need to get to London to see my dying father.<br><br>When my plane took off for London I still had no idea whether I would have any security protection when it landed. But that no longer mattered; after days of waiting I feared only that I might be too late. I knew that, if my father were to die, I would not be allowed to see his body. He would be whisked away by male relatives to be washed and prepared and buried within twenty-four hours. Women are not allowed to be present at the graveside during a Muslim burial ceremony. It is believed that their presence is disruptive; they might become hysterical, perhaps even hurl themselves into the grave to be with the corpse. It would be unseemly to try to attend.<br><br>My father had a contradictory attitude to women. He embraced some modern ideas on literacy, urged his first wife to attend university, and insisted that my sister Haweya and I go to school when my mother resisted the idea. He believed in women's strength and he repeatedly insisted that a woman's role was valuable and important. But as he aged he became more orthodox in his Islamic convictions that we must cover ourselves, marry, and submit to our husbands. Despite his often eccentric views, even my father would not have tolerated seeing a woman at a funeral.<br>When I arrived at Heathrow Airport in London a large black car from the Dutch Embassy was there to greet me; another, smaller but even safer, held men from Scotland Yard. We drove straight to the hospital.

Fully illustrated, the encyclopedia contains hundreds of alphabetically arranged entries which give succinct yet authoritative information on everything from the Qur&#39;an and its origins to the role of Islam in the USA.</p><p>Gordon D. Newby is Professor of Middle Eastern Studies and Director of the Institute for Comparative and International Studies at Emory University, Atlanta, USA.This is the sixth in Oneworld's concise, helpful encyclopedias on the world's religions, following volumes on the Baha'i faith, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Judaism. Since each encyclopedia is the work of a single author, the style within each is consistent. This volume is formatted like others in the series. But Newby (chair, Middle Eastern studies, Emory Univ.), the author of two other books and numerous articles on the Middle East, including a "reconstruction" of the earliest biography of the Prophet Muhammad, also includes a note on transliteration and pronunciation, a map of the Muslim world, a historical introduction, a chronology, a bibliography of works easily available in most libraries, and a thematic index. The brief entries provide salient details intended for the lay reader and cover individuals, events, and places, including countries with large Muslim populations. A few black-and-white illustrations help give visual definition to certain architectural and geographical entries. One gap in Newby's book is the incomplete coverage of the various Shi'ahaimams (Zaydi and Ithna Ashariyyah), all of whom warrant at least a brief entry. This work complements Ludwig W. Adamec's Historical Dictionary of Islam, which is pitched to a slightly more academic audience and has a more extensive bibliography but lacks illustrations.

By the author of Codebreaker&#39;s Victory. Original.</p><p>Hervie Haufler is a veteran World War II cryptographer who participated in both English and American codebreaking task forces. He is the author of the acclaimed <i>Codebreakers' Victory</i>. This is his second book.This compact survey of Allied double agents in WWII begins before the war, when British Intelligence "turned" Arthur George Owens, a Welsh engineer working for the Nazis. Owens's conversion inspired the formation of Britain's Twenty Committee (aka XX or Double Cross), which controlled the messages sent by double agents, as well as the country's systematic policy of using German intelligence agents for deception. As diverse as they were duplicitous, the double agents include Dusko Popov, a Yugoslav said to be the model for James Bond; Eddie Chapman, a British sociopath; Elvira Chaudoir, the daughter of a Peruvian diplomat; and Juan Pujol, a Spaniard nicknamed Garbo for his expertise at disguise. The author portrays these agents and others with a novelist's eye for character and suspense, revealing, for example, that Pujol's wife nearly blew his cover because she was tired of living in wartime England and that Popov might have prevented the attack on Pearl Harbor if not for a personal clash with J. Edgar Hoover. Haufler (<i>Codebreakers' Victory</i>) is a natural raconteur, and his stories may serve to spark new readers' interest in deeper study of WWII counterintelligence. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This first of four volumes by Michael Barthorp detailing the British Army on campaign from 1815-1902, centres on the campaigns in the eventful period from 1816-53: the regiments which took part; the tactics employed; and the changing nature of uniforms and equipment.</p><p>Michael Barthorp was educated at Wellington College and was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade in 1946. Demobilised in 1948, he served as a Territorial with The Royal Hampshire Regiment before rejoining the Regular Army in The Northamptonshire Regiment to continue a family tradition, ending his career with the Royal Anglian Regiment in 1968. He has since published numerous books on the British Army history and costume, including nine titles for the Men-at-Arms series. He lives in Jersey, Channel Islands. Pierre Turner has illustrated various titles for Osprey. He lives and works in Devon.</p><h2>A Taste Fur Murder: A Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Mystery (A Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Mystery, 1)</h2><p><p><b>Introducing an animal-loving Gal Friday with a telepathic cat, a shapeshifting dog, and a ghost of a chance of solving supernatural crime...</b></p><p>Meet Deirdre "Foxtrot" Lancaster. Trusted employee of eccentric zillionairess Zelda Zoransky, Foxtrot manages a mansion, a private zoo, and anything else that strikes her boss's fancy. Her job title is Administrative Assistant, but <i>chaos handler</i> would be more accurate. Especially after she glimpses a giant ghost-beast in Zelda's pet cemetery. For some strange reason, Foxtrot is seeing animal spirits. And, ready or not, in this mystery from Dixie Lyle, the fur's about to hit the fan...</p><p><b><i>A TASTE FUR MURDER</i></b></p><p>Still reeling, Foxtrot comes home to find her cat Tango&#x2015;her <i>dead</i> cat Tango&#x2015;alive and well and communicating telepathically. But that's not all: There's an ectoplasmic dog named Tiny who changes breeds with a shake of his tail...and can sniff out a clue like nobody's business. So when a coworker drops dead while organizing closets, Tiny is on the case. Can Foxtrot and her new companions ferret out the killer among a menagerie of suspects&#x2015;human and otherwise&#x2015;before death takes another bite?</p></p><p><p>Dixie Lyle, author <i>A Taste Fur Murder </i>from the Whiskey, Tango and Foxtrot Mysteries from St. Martin's Books, loves animals, mysteries, books, reading, words, bad puns (are there any other kind?) and once had a torrid summer romance with an entire library. Did I mention the books? Oh, and definitely doesn't believe in the supernatural. Nope, not me. Hey, what was that sound? Where's that spooky green glow coming from? Oh, hello, didn't see you standing there in the corner, what with you being all see-through and everything. Want a cup of tea? Moan once for yes, twice for no. <br>Allegations that Dixie Lyle has a goofy sense of humor are entirely unfounded, and should be forwarded to the unfounded and unlost department.</p>CHAPTER ONE <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Ever had a job that threatened to drive you straight into a loony bin? <br>I&#x2019;m an extremely capable, modern woman, but sometimes I feel like the mother of a dozen deranged children on a trip to the zoo, just after giving each one an espresso sundae and a megaphone. Screeching, pleading, yelling, crying; I have to deal with all of that at full volume while juggling a hundred different&#x2014;and sometimes bizarre&#x2014;tasks. <br>&#x201c;No, the tiger cage goes over <i>there</i>. Yes, I&#x2019;ll sign for that. Hello? Let me put you on hold. No, no, we don&#x2019;t get that in until Tuesday. I&#x2019;m sorry if the crab is fresh today, you&#x2019;ll just have to wait for the asparagus. Hello? I&#x2019;m sorry, Mr. Gates, the pool is being cleaned that week. I can schedule you for the seventeenth&#x2014;Bishop Tutu&#x2019;s going to make a souffl�. Excuse me, I told you <i>not</i> to put that there. Let me put you on hold&#x2014;Hello? Yes, that&#x2019;s not a mistake, that&#x2019;s how much dry ice we need delivered. Make two trips.&#x201d; <br>And so it goes. When you&#x2019;re the Gal Friday to a crazy old lady&#x2014;sorry, &#x201c;eccentric senior&#x201d;&#x2014;with too much time on her hands, too much money, and poor impulse control, you either learn to deal with the plural of the word <i>crisis</i> or become one yourself. <br>I have learned to deal. <br>My name is Deidre F. Lancaster. The <i>F</i> stands for &#x201c;Foxtrot,&#x201d; which started as a little joke between my parents and eventually became what everyone called me. I&#x2019;m five foot six, a hundred and cough cough pounds, my best physical feature is my dazzling smile, and my worst is my obstinate, currently brown hair. I work for a woman named Zelda Zoransky&#x2014;whom everyone calls ZZ&#x2014;and while my proper title is administrative assistant, I think <i>chaos wrangler</i> would be a better description. I keep that to myself, though. <br>Today was no different from any other day. I made phone calls, answered emails, delegated whenever I could&#x2014;which wasn&#x2019;t often&#x2014;and took deliveries while sucking back my umpteenth mug of Irish breakfast tea. <br>ZZ lived in a big old mansion on a big old estate, with two wings, large grounds, and her own private zoo. The zoo took up a lot of space, too, because ZZ believed in giving her animals room to roam; they also had their own private live-in vet to keep them healthy and happy, and ZZ gave priority to animals who needed a place to stay. Then there were the tennis courts, the Olympic-sized swimming pool, the gardens&#x2014;all that old money could buy and then some. <br>ZZ was a dear and I loved her to pieces, but working for her was a little like trying to ride a tornado that kept changing direction. About the only real constant were her salons&#x2014;regular gatherings of interesting and eclectic people ZZ read about online or in magazines. Scientists, authors, activists, movie stars, celebrities of every stripe; she&#x2019;d invite them all for a week of fine dining, lounging around the pool, and stimulating conversation. The only rule was that everybody had to attend the nightly dinners, which lasted for hours and always had an open bar. I had a standing invitation to attend anytime I wanted to. Sometimes I couldn&#x2019;t resist&#x2014;I mean, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to be present for a debate on ethics between Stephen Hawking and Mick Jagger? <br>Crunch time for a salon was always just before all the guests arrived, and I had finally gotten over that hump. Or at least that&#x2019;s what I thought before my boss showed up. <br>ZZ swept through my open door, wearing a bright, tropical caftan, sandals, and a chunky necklace of highly polished, square wooden beads. Her curly orange hair was piled on top of her head and held in place with a matching barrette. &#x201c;Foxtrot! There you are, dear. How&#x2019;s everything going?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see. Everybody&#x2019;s here, nobody&#x2019;s luggage is missing, the kitchen and bar are properly stocked, and the pool is clean.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excellent. I just have a few last-minute details for you to take care of.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shoot.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I want to raise that donation to the African girls&#x2019; school&#x2014;make it an even fifty thousand. Spielberg is messengering me a hard-to-find film from Korea he highly recommends and I&#x2019;d like to show it next week in the theater. I just finished this <i>amazing</i> book on the nutritional value of organic kale and I&#x2019;d like to serve some this week&#x2014;have Ben get some locally and do something interesting with it. Oh, and get the UPS guy something nice for his birthday, will you? It&#x2019;s on Tuesday and he&#x2019;s <i>such</i> a sweetheart.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How did you know it was Bernie&#x2019;s birthday?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re Facebook friends.&#x201d; <br>I smiled and made some notes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get right on it. Anything else?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. Has Caroline managed to find that dog yet?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d; For the last two days, a stray dog had been prowling around the grounds. ZZ was worried he might get hit by a car&#x2014;we&#x2019;re not that far from the highway&#x2014;or find his way into the zoo and get into worse trouble there. We have large animals on hand, and some of them would consider a dog a tasty snack. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s wily, I&#x2019;ll give him that,&#x201d; ZZ said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m starting to think&#x2014;no, it&#x2019;s ridiculous.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, I saw him when I was out for a walk this morning. He was in the gardens, sort of crouched under a bush. Just staring at me.&#x201d; <br>That worried me a little. ZZ described the dog as looking like a pit bull but larger and completely white; that made me nervous. Pit bulls could be aggressive. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t threatening you, was it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, that wasn&#x2019;t it at all. It seemed very alert, but not menacing. I decided I&#x2019;d try to approach it, but when I got closer it darted away. It ran toward a corner of the garden where there&#x2019;s a high wall&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;ZZ. Tell me you didn&#x2019;t corner a strange and possibly dangerous animal.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s just it&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t. When I got to the corner it was gone. Now, there&#x2019;s a little vegetation in the way so I couldn&#x2019;t see it all the time, but there&#x2019;s no way it could have gotten past me. It just <i>vanished</i>.&#x201d; <br>I frowned. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the explanation?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Depends on who you ask. I told Shondra what happened and she went to take a look.&#x201d; Shondra was ZZ&#x2019;s head of security. &#x201c;She thinks someone could have helped the dog over the wall before I got there, though I don&#x2019;t see how. And when I asked Shondra why someone would do that, she started talking about trained attack dogs and the kind of crazies that use them. She seems to think it&#x2019;s a professional assassin sent here by some white supremacist meth-lab biker gang.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I see. You tick off any white supremacist, meth-lab biker gangs lately?&#x201d; <br>ZZ got a thoughtful look on her face. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t <i>think</i> so&nbsp;&#x2026; but you know what the Internet&#x2019;s like, dear. It&#x2019;s so hard to tell these days.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, I kind of doubt you&#x2019;re being stalked by a deranged Nazi drug dealer with a killer pit bull, but I&#x2019;ll keep my eyes open.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Foxtrot.&#x201d; And she swept back out of the room. <br>It didn&#x2019;t take me long to polish off ZZ&#x2019;s chores. When they were out of the way, I considered what to do next: I could actually take a break, get a little fresh air, and hope my mobile didn&#x2019;t start buzzing. <br>My office was on the second floor, in a corner parapet with big windows. I looked out over the gently rolling sweep of the perfectly mowed grass below, taking comfort in its sprawling green lawnosity&#x2014;and then an ostrich tore through my placid field of vision. <br>A second later Caroline Durrell, the estate vet, tore after it. Oswald was loose again&#x2014;he was something of an avian Houdini. I sighed, and realized there was only one place I could go if I really wanted to relax. <br>I made it down the grand staircase, through the atrium, and out the front doors without anyone buttonholing me. It would&#x2019;ve been shorter to cut through the house, but that practically guaranteed I&#x2019;d get sidetracked by a guest, a staff member, or my own slightly obsessive behavior. Instead, I skirted around the main house, ducked through the corridor that led from the front yard to the pool in back, around that, and through the gate in the hedge. <br>Into the graveyard. <br>The Zoransky family had owned this land since before the turn of last century, back when most people still got around in horse-and-buggies instead of cars. This part of the estate was undeveloped then, filled with scrubby trees and big stumps, the area logged for its timber and then unoccupied. A local from the nearby town asked Obadiah Zoransky if he could bury his dog on the land, and Obadiah said yes. Somehow, the practice spread, and after a decade or so there were hundreds of ex-pets interred among the trees. <br>The trees were mostly gone now&#x2014;along with the stumps&#x2014;though a few tall oaks and maples still stood. The family had to clear them out to make space, because over the last century the graves multiplied until they reached into five digits; over fifty thousand at last count, ranging from the smallest goldfish to full-grown horses. It wasn&#x2019;t just animals here, either. More than a few human beings had elected to be laid to rest with their companions, though local regulations prevented actual burial&#x2014;instead, more than five hundred sealed urns containing human ashes could be seen atop headstones throughout the cemetery. <br>It was an overcast day, but the spring air was warm and full of the fresh smell of plant life eager to explode pollen straight up the nostrils of allergy sufferers everywhere. I headed down my usual route, past the life-sized statue of Piotr, the Russian circus bear, then right at the grave of a parrot inexplicably named Fish Jumping. This led to a small stand of trees nicknamed the Cathedral, six big oaks that surrounded Davy&#x2019;s Grave. Davy was the very first animal to be buried here, a golden retriever who loved to hunt with his owner. There were four marble benches around the plot, and it was a nice place to just sit and collect my thoughts. <br>I wasn&#x2019;t there for long before I was interrupted, though; I heard the roar of an industrial riding mower getting closer, then saw it crest the rise of a hill with Cooper, the groundskeeper, at the wheel. When he saw me he waved and shut the mower off, then dismounted and ambled over. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Cooper.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hey, Foxtrot.&#x201d; Cooper dressed like an old hippie, which was exactly what he was. Droopy gray mustache in a long but friendly face, long gray ponytail poking out from under a beat-up straw hat. Fringed buckskin vest over an ancient GRATEFUL DEAD T-shirt. Blue jeans belted around bony hips, buckled with a chrome peace symbol. Scuffed and dusty cowboy boots. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s things up to the house?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Same as always, Coop. Crazy casserole with a side of mayhem. How about you?&#x201d; <br>A rare frown crossed his face. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t complain, I guess. But something ain&#x2019;t right.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How so?&#x201d; <br>He shook his head. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t rightly say. The boneyard&#x2019;s been talking to me, though, and it don&#x2019;t sound happy.&#x201d; Cooper had a tendency to put things in quasi-mystical terms, even when he was talking about the most mundane subjects; he once told me that the plumbing in his caretaker&#x2019;s cottage was undergoing a nasty Mercury retrograde. Took me a while to realize that he was referencing astrology and not a toxic chemical spill. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it been saying?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing real specific. Just giving off weird vibes, you know? Had a dream last night that a catfish in a tuxedo tried to turn the place into an amusement park for crawdads. All the admission prices were in tadpoles.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You have to stop reading Dr. Seuss before you go to sleep, Coop.&#x201d; <br>He grinned at me, but I could see he was still worried. &#x201c;Maybe so. Hell, with everything I&#x2019;ve poured into my skull, I&#x2019;m lucky my dreams make any sense at all.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Still&nbsp;&#x2026; be careful out here, huh? Just &#x2019;cause I&#x2019;m paranoid don&#x2019;t mean I ain&#x2019;t right.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No problem, Coop. I&#x2019;ll keep my eyes open.&#x201d; <br>He tipped me a nod and a smile, then ambled on back to his mower, fired it up, and rode off over the hill. <br>I sat on the bench and inhaled deeply through my nose, enjoying the smell of fresh-cut grass. I closed my eyes. Nice, peaceful, quiet. <br>And then, in the dark behind my eyelids, I saw something. <br>A little flash of light, somewhere in the distance. I know it doesn&#x2019;t make sense, to talk about distance when you can&#x2019;t see any farther than your own shut eyes, but that&#x2019;s what it was like: as if I were looking out over a vast, pitch-black field, and something a hundred yards away had just lit up for the briefest second. <br> <i>Random neuron firing in my brain,</i> I told myself, and tried to ignore it. <br>It happened again. <br>This time it was as if the flash went off behind something, silhouetting it. Even though it was quite far away and there was nothing to provide scale, I had the strong impression it was something big. <br>I opened my eyes. Still sitting on the bench, marble cool and hard beneath my seat. Still quiet, still peaceful. &#x201c;Well, that was weird,&#x201d; I muttered. <br>I&#x2019;m the curious sort. I closed my eyes again. <br>Another flash, this one different. It wasn&#x2019;t so much a flash as a crackle, like a bolt of lightning that hung in the air for a second. It was brighter than before, and bigger. So was the shape it outlined, a kind of rounded hump. <br>No, not bigger. Closer. <br>My heart jumped and my eyes snapped open. Suddenly the graveyard didn&#x2019;t seem so peaceful&#x2014;or so empty. The quiet was the held breath of someone lurking just out of sight. <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said to myself. &#x201c;Lurking in your <i>imagination,</i> you idiot.&#x201d; I shook my head and forced a laugh. <br>But I didn&#x2019;t close my eyes. <br> <i>Coop&#x2019;s managed to spook you,</i> I thought. <i>You&#x2019;re stressed out, that&#x2019;s all. Probably drank too much tea and not enough H</i>2 <i>O today. Shake it off, lady&#x2014;time to go back to work.</i> <br>I got to my feet, glanced around nervously, then marched out of the Cathedral, wondering how long I&#x2019;d been in there; it seemed a lot darker than when I&#x2019;d entered. <br>Normally I kept my eyes straight ahead when I walked, but now I couldn&#x2019;t stop looking side-to-side, scanning the grave sites next to the path. They weren&#x2019;t always arranged in neat rows, and there were quite a few large structures: tombs, statuary, obelisks. I wouldn&#x2019;t admit to myself what I was watching for&#x2014; <br>There. <br>A flicker of light, the harsh kind given off by a flashbulb, behind that marble doghouse. <i>Somebody taking a picture, has to be</i>. <br>Except that for an instant I&#x2019;d seen something else, and it definitely wasn&#x2019;t someone with a camera. Something behind the doghouse but bigger than it&#x2014;three times its size, actually, almost as big as a real house. Something massive and rounded, but not like a hill; an organic shape. The shape of something alive&#x2014;or something that used to be. <br>I started to hurry. I hated myself for doing so, but I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get out of the graveyard. It didn&#x2019;t seem peaceful or relaxing or even safe, not anymore. <br>I didn&#x2019;t close my eyes. <br>I got all the way back to the gate in the hedge, yanked it open&#x2014;then stopped. Took a deep breath, turned around. Nothing behind me, of course, nothing except tombstones and grass and a few trees. <br>I closed my eyes. <br>For a second there was nothing, just empty blankness. Then another flash lit up that darkness, illuminating a huge, rounded mass shambling right at me. A tentacle that seemed to be made of pure shadow peeled itself away from the main bulk, reaching for me&#x2014; <br>I shrieked and stumbled backward, tripping over my own feet and landing on my butt. My eyes flew open. <br>I was alone. Just me and the dead. <br>I got shakily to my feet, closed the gate, and walked toward the house. Backward, with my eyes wide open. I managed to make it without falling in the pool. <br>Then I got in my car and drove home. I&#x2019;m not sure I blinked the entire way there. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&amp;nb...</p><h2>Ray Bradbury Unbound (Volume 2)</h2><p>In Ray Bradbury Unbound, Jonathan R.

Berger died before it was completed, but the text has been assembled and illustrated by his longtime collaborator and friend Sel�uk Demirel, and has an introduction by Maria Nadotti.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>What Time Is It?</i> is a profound and playful meditation on the illusory nature of time. Berger, the great art critic and Man Booker Prize&#x2013;winning author, reflects on what time has come to mean to us in modern life. Our perception of time assumes a uniform and ceaseless passing of time, yet time is turbulent. It expands and contracts according to the intensity of the lived moment. We talk of time &#x201c;saved&#x201d; in a hundred household appliances; time, like money, is exchanged for the content it lacks. Berger posits the idea that time can lengthen lifetimes once we seize the present moment. &#x201c;What-is-to-come, what-is-to-be-gained empties what-is.&#x201d;</p><p><b>John Berger</b> (1926&#x2013;2017), storyteller, essayist, screenwriter, dramatist, and critic, was one of the most internationally influential writers of the last fifty years.

Detective Inspector Hal Challis and his team must apprehend him before he strikes again. But first Challis must contend with the editor of a local newspaper, who undermines his investigation at every turn.</p><p>Garry Disher grew up in South Australia. In 1978 he was awarded a creative writing fellowship to Stanford University, where he wrote his first short-story collection. A full-time writer for many years, he is the author of more than forty titles--fiction, children&#39;s books, anthologies, history textbooks, and books about the craft of writing. With considerable local and international success--including the prestigious German Crime Fiction Prize for Dragon Man--Disher is one of Australia&#39;s most exciting and diverse writers.<b>Chapter One</b><br>Detective Inspector Hal Challis showered with a bucket at his feet. He kept it economical, but still the bucket overflowed. He toweled himself dry, dressed, and, while the espresso pot was heating on the bench-top burner in his kitchen, poured the bucket into the washing machine. Couple more showers and he&#x2019;d have enough water for a load of washing. Only 19 December but already his rainwater tanks were low and a long, dry summer had been forecast. He didn&#x2019;t want to buy water again, not like last summer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coffee was ready. As he poured he glanced at an old calendar pinned to the corkboard above his bench. He&#x2019;d bought the calendar by mail order three years ago, and kept it opened at March. The vintage airplane for that month was a prototype of the de Havilland DH84 Dragon. Then the toaster pinged and Challis hunted for the butter and the jam and finally took his toast and coffee on to the deck at the rear of his house.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The early sun reached him through the wisteria with the promise of a hot day ahead. He felt bone-tired. A suspected abduction on the Old Peninsula Highway two nights ago&#x2014;the investigation ultimately dumped into his lap. Frankston uniforms had taken the call, then referred it to the area Superintendent, who&#x2019;d rung at 1 a.m. and said, &#x201c;Maybe your boy&#x2019;s struck a second time, Hal.&#x201d; Challis had spent the next four hours at the scene, directing a preliminary search. When he&#x2019;d got home again at 5 a.m. yesterday there hadn&#x2019;t seemed much point in going back to bed, and he&#x2019;d spent the rest of the day in the car or on the phone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little four-stroke engine was chugging away on the bank of his neighbor&#x2019;s dam. Cows once drank there. Now the cows were gone and the hillside stretched back in orderly rows of vines. Challis couldn&#x2019;t spot his neighbor among the vines, but the man was there somewhere. He usually was, weeding, pruning, spraying, picking. Challis thought of the insecticide spray, of the wind carrying it to his roof, where the rain would wash it into his underground tank, and he tossed out his coffee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stepped down from the verandah and made a circuit of his boundary fence. Half a hectare, on a dirt lane west of the Old Peninsula Highway, tucked in among orchards, vineyards and a horse stud, and Challis made this walk every morning and evening as a kind of check on his feelings. Five years now, and still the place was his port in a storm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he collected the Age from his mailbox on the dirt lane at the front of his property, a voice called from the next driveway, &#x201c;Hal, have you got a minute?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man from the vineyard was walking toward him. Small, squint-eyed from the angling sun, about sixty. Challis waited, gazing calmly, as he did with suspects, and sure enough the man grew edgy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challis stopped himself. The fellow didn&#x2019;t deserve his CIB tricks. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Look, I realize it&#x2019;s nothing, but you know the ornamental lake I&#x2019;ve got, over near the house?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s been fishing in it,&#x201d; the neighbor said. &#x201c;After the trout. The thing is, they&#x2019;re scaring the birds away.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ibis, herons, a black swan, moorhens. Challis had watched them for half an hour one day, from a little hide the man had constructed in the reeds. &#x201c;Do you know who?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Probably kids. I found a couple of tangled lines and fishhooks, half a dozen empty Coke cans.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challis nodded. &#x201c;Have you informed the local station?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought, you being an inspector&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Inform the local station,&#x201d; Challis said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll send a car around now and then, make their presence felt.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very sorry, but it would look better if you lodged the complaint.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challis left soon after that. He locked the house, backed his Triumph out of the garage and turned right at his gate, taking the lane in bottom gear. In winter he negotiated potholes, mud and minor flooding; in summer, corrugations and treacherous soft edges.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove east, listening to the eight o&#x2019;clock news. At five minutes past eight he turned on to the Old Peninsula Highway, meeting it quite near the abduction scene, and headed south, toward the town of Waterloo, hearing the screams the dying leave behind them.<br><br>He could have been more helpful to the neighbor. He wondered what the man thought of him, a detective inspector and &#x201c;New Peninsula.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Peninsula. People talked about it as if it were cohesive and indivisible. You only did that if you didn&#x2019;t know it, Challis thought. You only did that if you thought its distinctive shape&#x2014;a comma of land hooking into the sea southeast of Melbourne&#x2014;gave it a separate identity, or if you&#x2019;d driven through it once and seen only beaches, farmland and quiet coastal towns.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that it covered a large area&#x2014;less than an hour by road from top to bottom, and about twenty minutes across at its widest point&#x2014;but to a policeman like Challis there were several Peninsulas. The old Peninsula of small farms and orchards, secluded country estates, some light industry and fishing, and sedate coastal towns populated by retirees and holidaying families, was giving way to boutique wineries, weekender farms, and back roads populated with bed-and-breakfast cottages, potteries, naturopathy clinics, reception centers, tearooms and galleries. Tourism was one of the biggest industries, and people with professions&#x2014;like Challis himself&#x2014;were flocking to buy rural hideaways. Some local firms made a good living from erecting American-style barns and installing pot-belly stoves, and costly four-wheel drives choked the local townships.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But although there was more money about, it wasn&#x2019;t necessarily going to more people. A community center counsellor friend of Challis&#x2019;s had told him of the growing number of homeless, addicted kids she dealt with. Industries and businesses were closing, even as families were moving into the cheap housing developments that were spreading at the fringes of the main towns, Waterloo and Mornington. The shire council, once one of the biggest employers, was cutting expenses to the bone, using managers whose sense of humanity had been cut to the bone. The adjustments were never forewarned or carried out face to face. Challis&#x2019;s counsellor friend now sold home-made pickles and jams at fairs and markets. There had been a letter, telling her she was redundant, her whole unit closed down. &#x201c;Just three days&#x2019; notice, Hal.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was happening everywhere, and the police were usually the ones to pick up the pieces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which didn&#x2019;t mean that the Peninsula wasn&#x2019;t a pleasant place to live in. Challis felt as if he&#x2019;d come home, finally.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the job suited him. In the old days of murder or abduction investigations he&#x2019;d been sent all over the state, city and bush, with a squad of specialists, but the Commissioner had introduced a new system, intended to give local CIB officers experience in the investigation of serious crimes alongside their small-time burglaries, assaults and thefts. Now senior homicide investigators like Challis worked a specific beat. Challis&#x2019;s was the Peninsula. Although he had an office in regional headquarters, he spent most of his time in the various Peninsula police stations, conducting investigations with the help of the local CIB, calling in the specialists only if he got derailed or bogged down. It was a job that entailed tact, and giving as much responsibility to the local CIB as possible, or the fallout was resentment and a foot-dragging investigation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn&#x2019;t expect that from the Waterloo CIB. He&#x2019;d worked with them before.<br><br>Challis drove south for twenty kilometers. The highway ran down the eastern side of the Peninsula, giving him occasional glimpses of the bay. Then the Waterloo refinery came<br>into view across the mangrove flats, bright oily flames on the chimneys, and glaring white tanks. There was a large tanker at anchor. The highway became a lesser road, bisecting a new housing estate, the high plank fences on either side hiding rooftops that varied greatly but were never more than a meter apart. He crossed the railway line and turned right, skirting the town, then left on to a main road that took him past timber merchants, boat yards, Peninsula Cabs, crash repairers, an aerobics center, the Fiddlers Creek pub and a corner lot crammed with ride-on mowers and small hobby tractors.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police station and the adjacent courthouse were on a roundabout at the end of High Street, opposite a Pizza Hut. Challis glanced down High Street as he turned. The water glittered at the far end; frosted Santas, reindeer, sleighs, candles, mangers and bells swung from lampposts and trees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He parked in the side street opposite the main entrance to the police station, got out, and walked into trouble.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That windscreen&#x2019;s not roadworthy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A uniformed constable, who had been about to get into a divisional van that idled outside the station with a young woman constable at the wheel, had changed his mind and was approaching Challis, flipping open his infringement book and fishing in his top pocket for a pen. He&#x2019;s going to book me, Challis thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve ordered a new windscreen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not good enough.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Triumph was low-slung. On the back roads of the Peninsula, it was always copping stones and pebbles, and one had cracked the windscreen on the passenger side.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This your car?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It is.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A snapping of fingers: &#x201c;License.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challis complied. The constable was large&#x2014;tall and bigboned, but also carrying too much weight. He was young, the skin untested by time and the elements, and his hair was cut so short that his scalp showed through. Challis had an impression of acres of pink flesh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Quickly, quickly.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A classic bully, Challis thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the constable saw the name on Challis&#x2019;s license, but, to his credit, did not flinch. &#x201c;Challis. Inspector Challis?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sir, that windscreen&#x2019;s not roadworthy. It&#x2019;s also dangerous.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I realize that. I&#x2019;ve ordered a new one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The constable watched him for a long moment, then nodded. He put his book away. &#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challis hadn&#x2019;t wanted to be booked, and telling the constable to follow the rules and book him would have been an embarrassment and an irritation for both of them, so he said nothing. The constable turned and made for the van. Challis watched it leave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A real prick, that one,&#x201d; a voice said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a work-dented Jeep parked outside the courthouse. The rear doors were open and a man wearing overalls was unloading air-conditioning vents. Challis glanced at the side of the Jeep: <i>Rhys Hartnett Air-Conditioning.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The bastard did me over yesterday. Hadn&#x2019;t been here five minutes and he booked me for a cracked tail-light. Shouted in my face, spit flying, like I was some kind of&nbsp; criminal.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challis steered the conversation away from that. &#x201c;Are you working in the police station?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man shook his head. &#x201c;The courthouse.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He snapped a business card at Challis. He did it in a way that seemed automatic, and Challis had a vision of hundreds of people walking around with unwanted cards in their pockets. He glanced at it. <i>Rhys Hartnett, Air-Conditioning Specialist.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, I wish you were doing the police station.&#x201d; Hartnett seemed to straighten. &#x201c;You a copper?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Just my luck. I was wasting my breath complaining to you about police tactics.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not necessarily,&#x201d; Challis said, turning away and crossing the road.</p><h2>Earth Sheltered Residential Design Manual</h2><p>Provides information on soil types, structural systems, waterproofing, heating, cooling, and landscaping</p><p></p><h2>Texas Electric Railway/With Maps (Bulletin 121, Central Electric Railfans&#39; Association)</h2><p>Fascinating history of the Texas Electric Railway which ran majestic interurbans from Denison to Waco by way of Dallas.

Once limited to whites and beiges, today's neutrals come in an overwhelming range of whispery pinks and yellows, organic grays, greens and browns, and even blacks. Each of the 150+ color palettes and combinations includes notes on where the color is best used; for example, on furniture or as trim. Mood boards, scrapbooks and beautiful images provide added inspiration. </p><p> Topics include:</p><ul> <li>Why neutrals are popular</li> <li>How neutrals work with other colors</li> <li>How to use neutrals to create spaciousness</li> <li>How to decide which color scheme to use</li> <li>Understanding the effect of light on color</li> <li>How to layer neutrals</li> <li>Using neutrals and bright colors.</li> </ul><p> The "Color Directory" has more than 220 pages of palettes and their variations. As well, Alice Buckley tells the stories behind such schemes as northern lights, Parisian elegance, ice cream, white heat and desert beauty. </p><p> For home decorators and interior designers, <b>Neutral Color Schemes</b> is an essential handbook. </p></p><p><p> <b>Alice Buckley</b> is an interior designer and textile designer in London. Her creative works have been exhibited and sold widely across North America and Europe. </p><p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p><i>"Home" is one of our most evocative words. It conjures up an image of warmth and shelter, of family and friends, a place of inspiration, sanctuary and peace. With so much that's important represented by this one place, it's no wonder that we're passionate about our homes and work to make them evermore comfortable and welcoming.</i></p> <p>Today's homes fulfill many functions beyond shelter and nurturing. We decorate our homes in ways that not only enable them to fulfill these needs but also to reveal our personalities, our aspirations, the very essence of ourselves and how we want others to see us. There are many ways of doing this. Among them are light and color, two qualities that surround us in our natural environment, which can dramatically influence and alter our living space. With these two magic wands we can dictate the energy of a space, its mood and comfort level. If we use them well, light and color can help us create a home that supplies the emotional and functional needs we look for in our homes and make them truly our own.</p> <p><b>Understanding neutrals</b><br> Among the many color palettes at our disposal, neutrals are probably the least understood. These colors are often dismissed as bland and nondescript, thought of as suitable only for hotels or homes about to go on the market, but neutrals have moved beyond those colors not found on the color wheel, such as white, black, gray, brown and tan. The latest neutrals are sophisticated hints at gentle color, and it's this subtlety that makes neutrals so exciting, versatile and effective.</p> <p>Recent years have seen an emergence of a new crop of colored neutrals. As we all strive for serenity within our homes, merging hints of colors that are muted and moody, create new, fresh schemes for our homes. Deep and dark hues such as khaki, olive and steely gray through to the lighter pink beiges of taupe and mink all form part of the modern neutral palette. With a huge range of color ideas, this book aims to help you make the most of new neutrals in your interior scheme and to achieve the mood or feeling you hope for in each room of your home.</p></p><h2>Return to Zion: The History of Modern Israel</h2><p>The history of modern Israel is a story of ambition, violence, and survival. <i>Return to Zion</i> traces how a scattered and stateless people reconstituted themselves in their traditional homeland, only to face threats by those who, during the many years of the dispersion, had come to regard the land as their home. This is a story of the &#x201c;ingathering of the exiles&#x201d; from Europe to an outpost on the fringes of the Ottoman Empire, of courage and perseverance, and of reinvention and tragedy.&nbsp;<br>Eric Gartman focuses on two main themes of modern Israel: reconstitution and survival. Even as new settlers built their state they faced constant challenges from hostile neighbors and divided support from foreign governments, as well as being attacked by larger armies no fewer than three times during the first twenty-five years of Israel&#x2019;s history. Focusing on a land torn by turmoil, <i>Return to Zion</i> is the story of Israel&#x2014;the fight for independence through the Israeli Independence War in 1948, the Six-Day War of 1967, and the near-collapse of the Israeli Army during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.&nbsp;<br>Gartman examines the roles of the leading figures of modern Israel&#x2014;Theodor Herzl, Chaim Weizmann, David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan, Yitzchak Rabin, and Ariel Sharon&#x2014;alongside popular perceptions of events as they unfolded in the post&#x2013;World War II decades. He presents declassified CIA, White House, and U.S. State Department documents that detail America&#x2019;s involvement in the 1967 and 1973 wars, as well as proof that the Israeli attack on the USS <i>Liberty</i> was a case of mistaken identity. <i>Return to Zio</i>n pulls together the myriad threads of this history from inside and out to create a seamless look into modern Israel&#x2019;s truest self.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Eric Gartman is an intelligence analyst for the United States Department of Defense who has lived and studied in Israel and traveled extensively throughout the Middle East."Gartman's writing is particularly effective at making the reader feel as if he were present during meetings, where one could cut the tension with a knife. . . .

Admired for &#x201c;a voice unlike any other&#x201d; (Cynthia Ozick) and a style both &#x201c;wry and poignant&#x201d; (<i>The New Yorker</i>), Lore Segal is a master literary stylist. <br><br>This volume collects some of her finest work&#x2014;including new and uncollected writing&#x2014;and selections from her novels, stories, and essays. <br><br>From her very first story&#x2014;which appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i> in 1961&#x2014;to today, Segal&#x2019;s voice has been unique in contemporary American literature: Hilarious and urbane, heartbreaking and profound, keen and utterly unsentimental. <br><br>Segal has often used her own biography as both subject and inspiration: At age ten she was sent on the Kindertransport from Vienna to England to escape the Nazi invasion of Austria; grew up among English foster families; and eventually made her way to the United States. This experience was the impetus for her first novel, <i>Other People&#x2019;s Houses</i>, and one that she has revisited throughout her career. <br> From that beginning, Segal&#x2019;s writing has ranged widely across form as well as subject matter. Her flawless prose and light touch belie the rigor and intelligence she brings to her art&#x2014;qualities that were not missed by the <i>New York Times</i> reviewer who pointedly observed, &#x201c;though it was not written by a man . . . Segal may have come closer than anyone to writing The Great American Novel.&#x201d;<br>With this volume comes a long-awaited career retrospective of an important American Writer.</p><p>LORE SEGAL is the author of the Pulitzer Prize finalist S<i>hakespeare's Kitchen</i>, as well as the novels <i>Half the Kingdom, Lucinella, Other People's Houses </i>and <i>Her First American</i>. She is the recipient of the American Academy and the Institutes of Arts and Letters Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, The O'Henry Prize and the Harold U. Ribalow Prize. She has written for <i>The New Yorker, The New York Times, Harper's Magazine,&nbsp;The New Republic,</i> and numerous other publications.&nbsp;She has also written children's books and translates from the German. Segal lives and works in New York City. <br><br>CATHERINE LACEY is author of the novels <i>Nobody is Ever Missing</i> and <i>The Answers</i>, and most recently, the short story collection <i>Certain American States</i>.The Journal I Did Not Keep: New and Selected Writing <br><b>DANDELION</b><p>That Henry James, when he got old, rewrote his early work was my excuse for revisiting, at ninety, a story I had written in my twenties, about a day my father and I spent in the Austrian Alps.</p><p>I wished Mutti were coming, but she had woken with one of her migraines. I stood outside the hotel, in the grass, getting my shoes wet with dew, waiting and wanting for nothing. &#x201c;Light tinkled among the trees,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;grasses gleamed sword-like,&#x201d; says my story. Curious how our language asks for similes. What is something &#x201c;like&#x201d;? The sky was &#x201c;like liquid light,&#x201d; I wrote. &#x201c;Liquid&#x201d; is close, but it&#x2019;s not quite the right word. &#x201c;The mountain&#x2019;s back looked like something sculpted; one had the feel of the distant footpath in the fingertips. Between the mountain and myself, the land cupped downward, containing light like a mist.&#x201d; How was it &#x201c;like a mist,&#x201d; the essence of which is to obscure? I remember it as a white, chilly presence. A dog barked and barked and barked and the purity of the air carried the sound to where I stood waiting.</p><p>On the road at the end of the hotel gardens, a group of silent walkers passed at the steady pace of those who have a day&#x2019;s march ahead of them, young people. I followed them with my eyes. This was the moment that the sun crested the mountain&#x2014;a sudden unobstructed fire. It outlined the young people&#x2019;s backs with a faintly furred halo, while here, in the garden, it caught the head of a silver dandelion, fiercely, tenderly transfigured into light. I experienced a bliss of thought, new and inevitable, and I said, &#x201c;<i>Lieber Gott</i>, if I ever ask you for anything, you don&#x2019;t even have to listen, because nothing is necessary except this.&#x201d; I knew that was right because of my vast happiness, and then my father called me and we walked out of the garden and started up the road.</p><p>My Vati was a tall man in excellent spirits. In August, the Viennese banks closed. In the mountains, my father wore knickerbockers and an Alpine hat with a feather. In his pocket he had a book in which to look up the names of the wayside flowers, trees, and birds. As we climbed, he pointed through the pines to the village farther and farther away below us. Vati&#x2019;s plan was to reach the <i>Alm</i> by noon and take our lunch in the <i>Alm</i> hut. Did I know, he asked me, what an <i>Alm</i> was? It was a meadow high in the mountains where the cowherd brought all the cows from the valley to spend the summer eating the healthful upper grass, but I was being the world-famous ice-skating star Lucinda in her velvet dress with a skirt that swirled when I did my world-famous pirouette and I couldn&#x2019;t listen to what my father was explaining.</p><br>&#x2014;<p>Oh, but the sky was blue! It is bluest when you lie on your side and look through the grasses that grow by your cheek. I watched a spider climb a stalk that bent under its weight.</p><p>I sat up. People were coming along the path, two men&#x2014;young men walking together, one talking, using his hands. The other, who walked with his eyes to the ground, brought up his head and said something that made the first one shout with laughter. I watched them. They slowed their steps to look back at the people coming behind them. One of the girls called gaily, and the two groups joined. That was what I wanted to do when I got older&#x2014;walk with friends, talking together and laughing.</p><p>I looked after them with a suddenly sharpened interest. &#x201c;You know something? Vati? I think those are the people I saw on the road this morning, when I was waiting for you. Vati, do you think they are the same people?&#x201d;</p><p>Vati was asleep. It was rare, it was awesome, to see a sleeping grown-up. His two shoes pointed skyward. Where his trouser leg folded back it exposed a piece of leg above the sock. I averted my eyes.</p><p>We resumed our ascent and it was hot and grew hotter. The climb became harder and steeper, until I thought I could not lift my foot to take the next step, and the next, and the next for the several hours it took us to reach the top.</p><p>It was many years later, lying in the semidark and stillness, cleaned up and dry, after birthing my baby, my first&#x2014;I could see where she lay wrapped, not crying, and everything was well&#x2014;that I remembered sitting at long last, after climbing beyond my strength, under a tree in the shade, breathing in and out.</p><p>You know you have reached the top of the mountain when you are looking at a new world, the existence of which, a moment ago, you could not have suspected, ranges upon ranges paling into the blue distance, and here a peak rising and a second and a third, the relation in which they stand to one another becoming familiar under the blue sky. On the green expanse the cows stand, or move a step from here to there. When they lower their slow heads to chew the grass, the bells around their necks softly jingle.</p><br>&#x2014;<p>My young folk sat at a long trestle table in the <i>Alm</i> hut. The cowherd, who sat with them, had a pipe between his teeth. The rumble of his voice, interrupted by the young people&#x2019;s chatter and laughter, made its way to the table where my Vati and I were having our <i>Mittagessen.</i> It was a meal that I still think about and have not been able to reproduce: <i>Kaiserschmarrn</i> (the Emperor&#x2019;s Pancake) served with blueberries. Alpine blueberries grow low to the ground and are both sweeter and sharper than the fruit you know. And a glass of fresh cow&#x2019;s milk.</p><p>I ate and watched. The girls were pretty and talked; the boys were tall and thin. I could see their knees. I loved how they clapped one another on the back and put pepper in one another&#x2019;s soup and liked one another. I wanted to talk about them and I asked Vati who they were and where they were going, but he quieted me with a gesture. Vati, a city man, took an interest in the Alpine type and wanted to listen to what the cowherd was saying.</p><p>There was a general movement&#x2014;the meal was breaking up. The young people gathered themselves. Vati and I followed them out of the cool dark of the hut into the sheer heat of midday. One of the boys, whose yellow hair jutted over his forehead, stood by the door adjusting the straps of his rucksack. Vati also took an interest in young people and questioned the boy about his party and their plans. Leaning against my father&#x2019;s leg, I listened to the boy&#x2019;s companionable answers and felt that life could offer no better happiness. Vati was reminded of his own young touring days and launched upon an anecdote. It was hot. I squeezed my eyes against the fierce brightness in which the blond boy&#x2019;s head expanded and contracted among the little waves of heat. Vati&#x2019;s voice proceeded upon the air, wanting to convey an idea of the exact conical rock formation that had been attempted. He described the attempt, and the failure that he, Vati, had predicted. I watched the boy&#x2019;s hands play nervously with the ends of his straps and said, &#x201c;Vati!&#x201d; saw the boy&#x2019;s eyes steal to where his companions waited a little way along the path, and said, &#x201c;Vati, let&#x2019;s <i>go</i>!&#x201d; Vati was recounting the witty remark made by himself in connection with said attempt and failure, laughing largely, recalling the occasion. The blond boy cackled foolishly. I saw the boy looking foolish and tugged on Vati&#x2019;s sleeve. &#x201c;<i>Let&#x2019;s go</i>!&#x201d; The boy excused himself, had his hand wrung long and heartily, dived for his freedom, and was received with laughter and a round of applause.</p><p>My face burned and I did not turn to look after the young people. They were going farther on and Vati and I started on our homeward journey.</p><p>The intensity of the midday light had burned the color out of things and deadened them. I was angry with the boy who had not wanted to hear Vati&#x2019;s story and had wanted to get away from Vati. I hated the young people who had clapped their hands and had laughed. My father was walking along in a flow of spirits, and I was sorry for him because I had not cared to listen to the things he wanted to tell me. I resented and disliked this bad feeling, which would not let me be comfortable and be Lucinda the world-famous skating star.</p><p>And I began to grizzle. I was tired, I said. There was a stone in my shoe and I didn&#x2019;t feel like carrying my cardigan. Vati stopped his yodelling and looked at me. There was no stone. Vati put the cardigan in his backpack. I rubbed my right temple with the back of my right hand and said I wanted to go home. We were <i>going</i> home, Vati said, we were on our way home, but I meant home <i>now.</i> Vati said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be home soon, we&#x2019;re almost home, in a couple of hours.&#x201d; He offered to tell me the story of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, and the fight between the mongoose and the snake, but he had told it to me before. &#x201c;How about an ice cream when we get home?&#x201d; I understood that my father did not know what to do with me when I was like this, and I was afraid. I knew that this was God&#x2019;s awe-full answer, for hadn&#x2019;t I told him in the morning, &#x201c;If I ever ask you for anything, you don&#x2019;t have to listen, because nothing is necessary except <i>this</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>The sun was gone, all light absorbed by the ring of mountains that stood around us, soft and velvet purple, without the play of color or movement save for our panicked descent. My father had hold of my wrist and hurried me along so that the stones rolled underfoot.</p></p><h2>Divine Comedy (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This single volume, blank verse translation of <em>The Divine Comedy</em> includes an introduction, maps of Dante's Italy, Hell, Purgatory, Geocentric Universe, and political panorama of the thirteenth and early fourteenth century, diagrams and notes providing the reader with invaluable guidance.

In this much anticipated book, Roy Manstan and Frederic Frese bring the story of Bushnell&#x2019;s revolutionary underwater machine to life.&#x201d;</i> - JERRY ROBERTS, Director, Connecticut River Museum</p><p>At the onset of the American Revolution, the British expected to quell the rebellion quickly with a show of overwhelming force. In an experiment in asymmetric warfare, David Bushnell created the first submarine vessel designed specifically &#x201c;for the destruction of vessels of war.&#x201d; On a quiet September night in 1776, sergeant Ezra Lee maneuvered Bushnell&#x2019;s strange little craft out from Manhattan and into the midst of the greatest naval fleet ever assembled in the Americas. Lee&#x2019;s goal was to sink the British flagship HMS Eagle by attaching a powerful explosive to its hull. Although the mission was unsuccessful, Bushnell&#x2019;s concept of submarine warfare was considered by George Washington to have been &#x201c;an effort of genius.&#x201d; </p><p>David Bushnell was raised in the town of Saybrook at the mouth of the Connecticut River. More than two centuries later, another Turtle would be launched into the same river within sight of Bushnell&#x2019;s first forays with his vessel during the summer of 1775. Under the direction of technical arts teacher Frederic J. Frese, students at Old Saybrook High School created a working replica of Bushnell&#x2019;s submarine, facilitated through an education partnership with the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Newport, Rhode Island, where Roy R. Manstan was a mechanical engineer and Navy trained diver. With twenty-first century submariners at the helm, the Turtle replica was subjected to a series of operational tests at the Mystic Seaport Museum in Mystic, Connecticut.</p><p> In <i>Turtle: David Bushnell&#x2019;s Revolutionary Vessel</i>, the authors provide new insight into Bushnell&#x2019;s &#x201c;engine of devastation,&#x201d; tracing the history of undersea warfare before Bushnell and the origin of the many innovations Bushnell understood would be necessary for conducting a covert submarine attack. The knowledge gained from testing the Turtle replica enabled the authors to speculate as to what America&#x2019;s first submariner Ezra Lee experienced that September night and what may have caused the attack to fail. </p></p><p><p>ROY R.

What readers won't get is a lot of information beyond a kind of outline or summary of major points. Long-range implications are beyond the scope of these titles. Each double-page chapter is introduced by a paragraph in bold type; subheadings effectively divide and organize content. The writing is straightforward; however, students may need definitions of some terms that are not included in the brief glossaries. The books are full of illustrations, including paintings (four of which are full-page cutaway views with see-through plastic overlays), reproductions, graphs, and maps. While placed appropriately, some of the visuals in Industrial are too small to be very informative; most, however, are well chosen and add to readers' understanding of the text. Industrial may be unique in its scope and treatment of the topic for this age level. Vikings is slightly more comprehensive and for an older audience than Robert Nicholson's Vikings (Chelsea, 1994) or Margaret Mulvihill's Viking Longboats (Watts, 1989) and is comparable to, but more attractive than, Pamela Odjik's Vikings (Silver Burdett, 1990).

Nicola Bell, Permaculture Works</p><h2>Journey Through Ten Thousand Veils</h2><p>Born in a Jewish family, Maryam Kabeer was led to live in India and Nepal, and in monasteries in Europe, and then guided to embrace Islam at the hands of an ancient Sufi Master a few minutes away from the tomb of the Prophet Abraham. She then was guided to study intensively with Sufi Masters around the world. Her journey to the holy places and people of the earth, led her finally to Africa and the deep truth that all lives are totally interconnected and united with our own. This book is a significant and revealing social commentary, also dispelling many other myths and stereotypes such as the proposition, often fostered by the media, that women are inevitably oppressed in Islam. On the contrary, it is by entering into the heart of Islam that the author was liberated, elevated, empowered, and guided to realize the true purpose of her existence.</p><p><b>Maryam Kabeer Faye</b>&nbsp;is a Sufi master and a frequent speaker on Islam and Sufism.Throughout my childhood, I was aware of the existence of subtle realms, realities, and beings other than those of the apparent world in which I was living. I saw in one of many dreams that I was standing in the middle of a circle of seven ancient men who were blowing upon me, blessing and initiating me. This dream revealed the truth that I would meet such beings of light, who would initiate and lead me with the light of guidance. Even at this time, the spirit of guidance was manifesting in the outer world, just as it was within, and various people appeared as beacons in my life, exemplifying the message my father was singing about, the message of universal love, justice, unity, and peace,which was already, truly, singing in my heart. <p>One of these people was Sophie's father, Abe Wieselman.

Accompanying DVD can also be found on Amazon. <br><br> Like a tattoo, the fundamental truths of the faith are supposed to be permanently etched into us. However, a lifetime of learning, loving, and living the scriptures requires that at some point, we really begin to understand where they come from and what they mean. <br><br> The Absolute Basics of the Christian Faith is a visual introduction to the core beliefs of the Christian faith. While it assumes no background knowledge of the scriptures or church teachings, this eight-week study is stocked with rich explanation and engaging videos that bring catechesis to life for people of all ages, backgrounds, and stops along their spiritual journey. Like all books, it is possible to read this one alone, but it is designed specifically to be studied in community-to lead small and large groups through the big ideas of the faith. The memory verses, catechism, text, and videos in each lesson work together seamlessly to provide a clear, compelling introduction to Christian belief. <br><br> In working through this study, you'll be binding the truth about God on your head, hands, and house through scripture memorization and by learning the answers to important questions about God. Obeying Jesus takes a lifetime of learning. As you enter this study, let God's grace shape and change you. This is what it means to be a disciple.</p><p></p><h2>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2><p>During his third year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter must confront the devious and dangerous wizard responsible for his parents&#39; deaths.</p><p>For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.

Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. <br>Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts." <br>Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends.

Then comes the terrible day when her father remarries and everything changes. Her stepmother makes her sew in the dreary basement. Her stepsisters mock her shabby dress. And to top it off, the new Mrs. Cinders forbids Ella to attend the duke's grand ball. Heartbroken, Ella is sure that her life will never be what she dreamed. But with the help of a fairy godmother and some sparkling courage of her own, this Cinderella discovers that dreams can come true in the most unexpected of ways. <br> Join Ella amidst the dazzle and fashion of the roaring twenties as she takes happily ever after into her own hands!</p><p>Starred Review. Grade 1-4&#x2013;Is there room for one more "Cinderella" variant in your collection? The answer is yes if it's this charming version set in the 1920s. Ella Cinders, her father, and Buttons the doorman/delivery boy run a dress shop until the terrible day when Mr. Cinders remarries and his nasty new wife moves in with her equally nasty daughters, Ruby and Pearl. "His new wife seemed to pop up from nowhere like a sharp-eyed, expensively dressed jack-in-the box." Ella's life is misery from then on, mitigated only by the care and attention of the faithful Buttons. Her Fairy Godmother sends her off to the ball where the Duke of Arc is smitten with her, but in the end Ella chooses a different happily ever after, with Buttons. Hughes's gouache-and-pen-line illustrations exhibit her usual meticulous attention to detail, with the ball scenes inspired by Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers movies, and the original dress designs by important French couturiers of the period. This insightful retelling also offers a fascinating visual peek at a glamorous time.<i>&#x2013;Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.K-Gr. 3. It's the 1920s, and Ella Cinders works with her father in his dress shop, along with their young doorman, Buttons. After Mr. Cinders remarries, his new wife puts him under her thumb. Ella is soon exhausted from working at her sewing machine, while her stepsisters are modeling the gowns Ella has designed. The story follows a traditional course until the very end. When the suave socialite duke puts the slipper on Ella's foot, she dismisses him and turns to Buttons, who has been her solace through her ordeal. Together they will go off and start a shop of their own, a more preferable life than being "dressed like an expensive doll." A stylish enough work, this is a bit of an indulgence for Hughes, and the high-fashion setting and the flapper costumes don't add much to the tale for a young audience. The new ending will get their attention, however, and this self-empowered Cinderella makes for an interesting change of pace. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Reprint. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>Frederick Libby downed 24 confirmed enemy aircraft as a gunner and pilot in the Royal Flying Corps and retired from the U.S. Army Signal Corps with the rank of captain. After the war, he married and raised a family in Southern California. He became a wildcatter and made and lost a fortune exploring for oil. He died in 1970.It is surprising that this remarkable World War I memoir, written shortly after 1918, has remained unpublished for 82 years. Author Libby survived the war and died in 1970, but he left a powerful account of his three years of aerial combat over the trenches in France, first as an observer/gunner and later as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps. Libby was an American cowboy from Colorado. By 1914, at age 22, he was in Canada and joined the Canadian Army for the travel and adventure offered by a world war. The first half of the book is Libby's tale of cowpunching and horsebreaking in the last decades of the Old West. Even better, however, is the second half, where he vividly relates his at once hilarious and terrifying experiences as an American flying in a British aircraft against swarms of German fighter planes. Credited with 24 aerial victories, Libby was the first American to be awarded England's Military Cross for valor, presented by King George V himself. By volunteering before America entered the war, Libby lost his citizenship, but he clearly has no regrets. This colorful, stirring memoir leaves no doubt that he made the right decision, and it serves as a grim reminder of the archaic chivalry and cold-blooded nature of early aerial warfare.

Ever finish eating a bag of French fries even though they were cold, limp, and soggy? It hurts to answer questions like these.<br><br>Why do we overeat food that doesn&#x2019;t even taste good?<br><br>We overeat because there are signals and cues around us that tell us to eat. It&#x2019;s simply not in our nature to pause after every bite and contemplate whether we&#x2019;re full. As we eat, we unknowingly&#x2013;mindlessly&#x2013;look for signals or cues that we&#x2019;ve had enough. For instance, if there&#x2019;s nothing remaining on the table, that&#x2019;s a cue that it&#x2019;s time to stop. If everyone else has left the table, turned off the lights, and we&#x2019;re sitting alone in the dark, that&#x2019;s another cue. For many of us, as long as there are still a few milk-soaked Fruit Loops left in the bottom of the cereal bowl, there is still work to be done. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if we&#x2019;re full, and it doesn&#x2019;t matter if we don&#x2019;t even really like Fruit Loops. We eat as if it is our mission to finish them.<br>Stale Popcorn and Frail Willpower<br>Take movie popcorn, for instance. There is no &#x201c;right&#x201d; amount of popcorn to eat during a movie. There are no rules of thumb or FDA guidelines. People eat however much they want depending on how hungry they are and how good it tastes. At least that&#x2019;s what they say.<br><br>My graduate students and I think different. We think that the cues around us&#x2013;like the size of a popcorn bucket&#x2013;can provide subtle but powerful suggestions about how much one should eat. These cues can short-circuit a person&#x2019;s hunger and taste signals, leading them to eat even if they&#x2019;re not hungry and even if the food doesn&#x2019;t taste very good.<br><br>If you were living in Chicago a few years back, you might have been our guest at a suburban theater matinee. If you lined up to see the 1:05 p.m. Saturday showing of Mel Gibson&#x2019;s new action movie, <i>Payback</i>, you would have had a surprise waiting for you: a free bucket of popcorn.<br><br>Every person who bought a ticket&#x2013;even though many of them had just eaten lunch&#x2013;was given a soft drink and either a medium-size bucket of popcorn or a large-size, bigger-than-your-head bucket. They were told that the popcorn and soft drinks were free and that we hoped they would be willing to answer a few concession stand-related questions after the movie.<br><br>There was only one catch. This wasn&#x2019;t fresh popcorn. Unknown to the moviegoers and even to my graduate students, this popcorn had been popped five days earlier and stored in sterile conditions until it was stale enough to squeak when it was eaten.<br><br>To make sure it was kept separate from the rest of the theater popcorn, it was transported to the theater in bright yellow garbage bags&#x2013;the color yellow that screams &#x201c;Biohazard.&#x201d; The popcorn was safe to eat, but it was stale enough one moviegoer said it was like eating Styrofoam packing peanuts. Two others, forgetting they had been given it for free, asked for their money back. During the movie, people would eat a couple bites, put the bucket down, pick it up again a few minutes later and have a couple more bites, put it back down, and continue. It might not have been good enough to eat all at once, but they couldn&#x2019;t leave it alone.<br><br>Both popcorn containers&#x2013;medium and large&#x2013;had been selected to be big enough that nobody could finish all the popcorn. And each person was given his or her own individual bucket so there would be no sharing.<br><br>As soon as the movie ended and the credits began to roll, we asked everyone to take their popcorn with them. We gave them a half-page survey (on bright biohazard-yellow paper) that asked whether they agreed to statements like &#x201c;I ate too much popcorn,&#x201d; by circling a number from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree). As they did this, we weighed their remaining popcorn.<br><br>When the people who had been given the large buckets handed their leftover popcorn to us, we said, &#x201c;Some people tonight were given medium-size buckets of popcorn, and others, like yourself, were given these large-size buckets. We have found that the average person who is given a large-size container eats more than if they are given a medium-size container. Do you think you ate more because you had the large size?&#x201d; Most disagreed. Many smugly said, &#x201c;That wouldn&#x2019;t happen to me,&#x201d; &#x201c;Things like that don&#x2019;t trick me,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty good at knowing when I&#x2019;m full.&#x201d;<br><br>That may be what they believed, but it is not what happened.<br><br>Weighing the buckets told us that the big-bucket group people ate an average of 173 more calories of popcorn. That is roughly the equivalent of 21 more dips into the bucket. Clearly the quality of food is not what led them to eat. Once these moviegoers started in on their bucket, the taste of the popcorn didn&#x2019;t matter. Even though some of them had just had lunch, people who were given the big buckets ate an average of 53 percent more than those given medium-size buckets. Give them a lot, and they eat a lot.<br><br><i>And this was five-day-old, stale popcorn</i>!<br><br>We&#x2019;ve run other popcorn studies, and the results were always the same, however we tweaked the details. It didn&#x2019;t matter if our moviegoers were in Pennsylvania, Illinois, or Iowa, and it didn&#x2019;t matter what kind of movie was showing, all of our popcorn studies led to the same conclusion. People eat more when you give them a bigger container. Period. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether the popcorn is fresh or fourteen days old, or whether they were hungry or full when they sat down for the movie.<br><br>Did people eat because they liked the popcorn? No. Did they eat because they were hungry? No. They ate because of all the cues around them&#x2013;not only the size of the popcorn bucket, but also other factors I&#x2019;ll discuss later, such as the distracting movie, the sound of people eating popcorn around them, and the eating scripts we take to movie theaters with us. All of these were cues that signaled it was okay to keep on eating and eating.<br><br>Does this mean we can avoid mindless eating simply by replacing large bowls with smaller bowls? That&#x2019;s one piece of the puzzle, but there are a lot more cues that can be engineered out of our lives. As you will see, these hidden persuaders can even take the form of a tasty description on a menu or a classy name on a wine bottle. Simply<i> thinking</i> that a meal will taste good can lead you to eat more. You won&#x2019;t even know it happened.<br>As Fine as North Dakota Wine<br><br>The restaurant is open only 24 nights a year and serves an inclusive prix-fixe theme dinner each night. A nice meal will cost you less than $25, but to get it you will have to phone for reservations and be seated at either 5:30 or 7:00 sharp. Despite these drawbacks, there is often a waiting list.<br><br>Welcome to the Spice Box. The Spice Box looks like a restaurant; it sounds like a restaurant; and it smells like a restaurant. To the people eating there, it <i>is</i> a restaurant. To the people working there, it&#x2019;s a fine dining lab sponsored by the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The Spice Box is a lab where culinary hopefuls learn whether a new recipe will fly or go down in flames. It&#x2019;s a lab where waitstaff discover whether a new approach will sizzle or fizzle. It&#x2019;s also a lab where consumer psychologists have figured out what makes a person nibble a little or inhale it all.<br><br>There is a secret and imaginary line down the middle of the dining room in the Spice Box. On one Thursday, diners on the left side of the room might be getting a different version of the shrimp coconut jambalaya entr�e than those on the right. On the next Thursday, diners on the left side will be given a menu with basic English names for the food, while those on the right will be given a menu with French-sounding names. On the Thursday after that, diners on the left side will hear each entr�e described by a waiter, while those on the right will read the same descriptions off the menu. At the end of the meal, sometimes we ask the diners some short survey questions, but other times we carefully weigh how much food our guests have left on their plates. That way we don&#x2019;t have to rely on what they say, we can rely on what they do&#x2013;which version of shrimp coconut jamba- laya they polished off.<br><br>But on one dark Thursday night in the first week of February 2004, something a little more mischievous was planned for diners who braved the snow to keep their reservations. They were getting a full glass of Cabernet Sauvignon before their meal. Totally free. Compliments of the house.<br><br>This cabernet was not a fine vintage. In fact, it was a $2 bottle sold under the brand name Charles Shaw&#x2013;popularly known as Two Buck Chuck. But our diners didn&#x2019;t know this. In fact, all the Charles Shaw labels had been soaked off the bottles and replaced with professionally designed labels that were 100 percent fake.<br><br>Those on the left side of the room were being offered wine from the fictional Noah&#x2019;s Winery, a new California label. The winery&#x2019;s classic, italicized logo was enveloped by a simple graphic of grapes and vines. Below this, the wine proudly announced that it was &#x201c;NEW from California.&#x201d; After the diners arrived and were seated, the waiter or waitress said, &#x201c;Good evening and welcome to the Spice Box. As you&#x2019;re deciding what you want to eat this evening, we&#x2019;re offering you a complimentary glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. It&#x2019;s from a new California winery called Noah&#x2019;s Winery.&#x201d; Each person was then poured a standard 3.8-ounce glass of wine.<br><br>About an hour later, after they had finished their meal and were paying for it, we weighed the amount of wine left in each glass and the amount of the entr�e left on each plate. We also had a record of when each diner had started eating and when they paid their bill and left.<br><br>Diners on the right side of the room had exactly the same dining experience&#x2013;with one exception. The waiter or waitress&#x2019;s carefully scripted welcome introduced a cabernet &#x201c;from a new <i>North Dakota</i> winery called Noah&#x2019;s Winery.&#x201d; The label was identical to that on the first bottle, except for the words &#x201c;NEW from North Dakota.&#x201d;<br><br>There is no Bordeaux region in North Dakota, nor is there a Burgundy region, nor a Champagne region. There is, however, a Fargo region, a Bismarck region, and a Minot region. It&#x2019;s just that there are no wine grapes grown in any of them. California equals wine. North Dakota equals snow or buffalo.<br><br>People who were given &#x201c;North Dakota wine&#x201d; believed it was North Dakota wine. But since it <i>was</i> the same wine we poured for those who thought they were getting California wine, that shouldn&#x2019;t influence their taste. Should it?<br><br>It did. We knew from an earlier lab study that people who thought they were drinking North Dakota wine had such low expectations, they rated the wine as tasting bad <i>and</i> their food as less tasty. If a California wine label can give a glowing halo to an entire meal, a North Dakota wine label casts a shadow onto everything it touches.<br><br>But our focus that particular night was whether these labels would influence <i>how much</i> our diners ate.<br><br>After the meals were over, the first thing we discovered was that both groups of people drank about the same amount of wine&#x2013;all of it. This was not so surprising. It was only one glass of wine and it was a cold night. Where they differed was in how much food they ate and how long they lingered at their table.<br><br>Compared to those unlucky diners given wine with North Dakota labels, people who thought they had been given a free glass of California wine ate 11 percent more of their food&#x2013;19 of the 24 even cleaned their plates. They also lingered an average of 10 minutes longer at their table (64 minutes). They stayed pretty much until the waitstaff starting dropping hints that the next seating would be starting soon.<br><br>The night was not quite as magical for those given wine with the North Dakota label. Not only did they leave more food on their plates, this probably wasn&#x2019;t much of a meal to remember, because it went by so fast. North Dakota wine drinkers sat down, drank, ate, paid, and were out in 55 minutes&#x2013;less than an hour. For them, this was clearly not a special meal, it was just food.<br><br>Exact same meals, exact same wine. Different labels, different reactions.<br><br>Now, to a cold-eyed skeptic, there should have been no difference between the two groups. They should have eaten the same amount and enjoyed it the same.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t. <i>They mindlessly ate</i>. That is, once they were given a free glass of &#x201c;California&#x201d; wine, they said to themselves: &#x201c;This is going to be good.&#x201d; Once they concluded it was going to be good, their experience lined up to confirm their expectations. They no longer had to stop and think about whether the food and wine were really as good as they thought. They had already decided.<br><br>Of course, the same thing happened to the diners who were given the &#x201c;North Dakota&#x201d; wine. Once they saw the label, they set themselves up for disappointment. There was no halo; there was a shadow. And not only was the wine bad, the entire meal fell short.<br><br>After our studies are over, we &#x201c;debrief&#x201d; people&#x2013;often by e-mail&#x2013;and tell them what the study was about and what results we expect. For instance, with our different wine studies, we might say, &#x201c;We think the average person drinking what they believe is North Dakota wine will like their meal less than those given the &#x2018;California&#x2019; wine.&#x201d; We then ask the kicker: &#x201c;Do you think you were influenced by the state&#x2019;s name you saw on the label?&#x201d; Almost all will give the exact same answer: &#x201c;No, I wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>In the thousands of debriefings we&#x2019;ve done for hundreds of studies, nearly every person who was &#x201c;tricked&#x201d; by the words on a label, the size of a package, the lighting in a room, or the size of a plate said, &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t influenced by that.&#x201d; They might acknowledge that others could be &#x201c;fooled,&#x201d; but <i>they</i> don&#x2019;t think they were. That is what gives mindless eating so much power over us&#x2013;we&#x2019;re not aware it&#x2019;s happening.<br><br>Even when we <i>do</i> pay close attention we are suggestible&#x2013;and even when it comes to cold, hard numbers. If you ask people if there are more or less than 50 calories in an apple, most will say more. When you ask them how many, the average person will say, &#x201c;66.&#x201d; If you had instead asked if there were more or less than 150 calories in an apple, most would say less. When you ask them how many, the average person would say, &#x201c;114.&#x201d; People unknowingly anchor or focus on the number they first hear and let that bias them.<br><br>A while back, I teamed up with two professor friends of mine&#x2013;Steve Hoch and Bob Kent&#x2013;to see if anchoring influences how much food we buy in grocery stores. We believed that grocery shoppers who saw numerical signs such as &#x201c;Limit 12 Per Person&#x201d; would buy much more than those who saw signs such as &#x201c;No Limit Per Person.&#x201d; To nail down the psychology behind this, we repeated this study in different forms, using different numbers, different promotions (like &#x201c;2 for $2&#x201d; versus &#x201c;1 for $1&#x201d;), and in different supermarkets and convenience stores. By the time we finished, we knew that <i>any</i> sign with a number promotion leads us to buy 30 to 100 percent more than we normally would.<br><br>After the research was completed and published in the <i>Journal of Marketing Research</i>, another friend and I were in the checkout line at a grocery store, where I saw a sign advertising gum, &#x201c;10 packs for $2.&#x201d; I was eagerly counting out 10 packs onto the conveyer belt, when my friend commented, &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you just publish a big research paper on that?&#x201d;<br><br>We&#x2019;re <i>all</i> tricked by our environment.

The priests and teachers of the past traditions and civilizations have taught that man in his totality is a key that will unlock the hidden mysteries of God and the universe. Knowledge of Self, revealed through the disciplines of prayer and meditation, brings with it the power to create, the power to direct and control the forces of nature, guiding them through the channels of the subtle bodies for purposes of self realization, self-expression and healing. Thus man becomes conscious co-creator of the universe, a server of the race and an expression of God incarnate.&#34; -- from the back cover</p><p></p><h2>Austerlitz 1805: Cassell Military Paperbacks</h2><p>Detailed explanation of the 1805 battle of Austerlitz.

Its first expression was in the idea of the covenant between God and the Israelites: Charisma&#x2013;religious grace and authority&#x2013;was transferred through divine inspiration to the Old Testament prophets; it was embodied by Jesus of Nazareth, the first true charismatic hero. Rieff shows how St. Paul transformed charisma into a form of social organization, how it was reworked by Martin Luther and by nineteenth-century Protestant theologians, and, finally, how Max Weber redefined charisma as a secular political concept. By emptying charisma of its religious meaning, Weber opened the door to the modern perception of it as little more than a form of celebrity, stripped of moral considerations.<br><br>Rieff rejects Weber&#x2019;s definition, insisting that Weber misunderstood the relation between charisma and faith. He argues that without morality, the gift of grace becomes indistinguishable from the gift of evil, and it devolves into a license to destroy and kill in the name of faith or ideology. Offering brilliant interpretations of Kierkegaard, Weber, Kafka, Nietzsche, and Freud, Rieff shows how certain thinkers attacked the very possibility of faith and genuine charisma and helped prepare the way for the emergence of a therapeutic culture in which it is impossible to recognize that which is sacred. Rieff&#x2019;s analysis of charisma is an analysis of the deepest level of crisis in our culture.</p><p>Philip Rieff was born in Chicago in 1922 and received his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1954. He taught at Brandeis University, the University of California at Berkeley, and Harvard University. For thirty years, until his retirement in 1992, he was the Benjamin Franklin Professor of Sociology and University Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. His books <i>include Freud: The Mind of the Moralist </i>and<i> The Triumph of the Therapeutic</i>. Rieff died in July 2006.<b>Chapter One: Spray-on Charisma</b><br><br>It all seems perfectly plausible; in fact, the item advertised on p. 2 of this book may be on the market now, having seen it prophesied in the <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon.<br><br>Is it not likely that since all action is now decided from the outside in that a spray-on charisma can will soon be invented? We shall have the recognition factors sorted out, and so by purchase smartly in the economy size, spray ourselves into something extraordinary. This is simply to say what S�ren Kierkegaard said more than a century ago, that all inwardness is lost. In this book, I have tried to work through, critically, toward an understanding of how my inwardness was lost for me, and to recognize those chiefly responsible for the loss&#x2014;our charismatics. The writing has not been therapeutic; on the contrary, that is the point. From the extraordinary way in which Max Weber, among others, canned charisma for us, I have learned that I am opposed to all therapies. The therapeutic is that terrible beast who has been slouching toward Bethlehem. The pity of our lives is that there are no charismatics to save us from him. We can hope for the spray-on charisma can, which will realize the ancient dream of making even the least of us extraordinarily attractive on the outside. The world is fuller than ever before of people who look like charismatics and try to act the part; like the early medieval sect of Waldenses, they insist on wearing sandals, some even in winter. If not to be like the founder, which was the original reason for wearing sandals, then to be recognizable, a little extraordinary, in lieu of the spray-on charisma can. I doubt that the Western world has ever been so full of innovators all hawking their changes, or so full of deviants, all asserting their rights. Where are the charismatics? The question is, more precisely, who are the charismatics? Who deviates decisively from the beaten path? Who opens a new road, a different way of life and revelation for men to go, even remain, for such openers of new roads are all but lost. Is he a guru, like Timothy Leary, for the guru, in its original meaning, meant, I understand, heavy, weighty, venerable. A modern guru, a figure like Timothy Leary or Norman O. Brown, carries the reverse meaning. He is deliberately weightless and preaches weightlessness to us. The modern guru represents the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent. It is in this sense that he is an exemplar, someone to follow.<br><br>Where are our gifted leaders, our charismatics? Perhaps the idea itself is an illusion and not only has no future, but has no past. My position in this book will be that there is no charisma without creed&#x2014;there must be a conscious and intense established symbolic* in the field before there can be a standard that can be used to break through that field. Doubt, skepticism, infidelity, are not charisma, nor are they therapy, the two major terms I shall use throughout this book. Yet charisma proclaims something to be true and important. In Weber&#x2019;s idea, it announces a way, it lights the fire of a new interdict, it has the emphasis of infallibility, no less than that which it breaks through. But I ask again, where are our charismatics? Certainly, we have stunning numbers of people who copy the outward features of the charismatic. They insist on wearing sandals. But there is a great new perplexity in an anti-credal order such as our own, because being therapeutics now there is no correlation between soul and body. All is body. Nothing material now emanates from the spiritual. We are mirrors still, but not mirrors of some spiritual or inner reality from which our appearance is derived. Rather, our world is as a theater, and in that theater, rather than the world as church, the program announces the end of all sacramental action; wearing sandals itself must be put in quotation marks&#x2014;it is a role, a put-on, one of the many costumes that may be worn, one of the transformations and adjustments for which the therapeutic more or less consciously can prepare himself.<br><br>It is through Weber that charisma promises to be, and has become, a marketable item. But in the course of this book, I shall look at charisma as it has been considered before Weber and after. And the book itself intends to go beyond Weber&#x2019;s thought and to try to establish what a charismatic may be, if he is to oppose the therapeutic. Therapeutic and charismatic are proposed in this book as ideal anti-types. Thus, for Weber, the charismatic leader proposes a radical breakthrough, a transformation of those transgressive motifs proposed by him in his Protestant pathos as shadowing of a new normative order. The therapeutic, on the other hand, also proposes a radical transformation of transgressive motifs, but not as foreshadowings of a new normative order. Indeed, the key to understanding the therapeutic as the successor ideal anti-type of the charismatic is that he hopes for, as his own lifestyle proclaims, a society in which there is no normative order. It is further my intention to demonstrate how the modern Protestant and Weberian conceptions of the charismatic in fact lead toward this successor type, the therapeutic, and toward a transformation of transgressive motifs in a way that throws no shadow of normative order upon the future. My thesis shall be that the therapeutic is the ideal anti-type and real successor of the charismatic. I understand the charismatic as somehow in truth an innovative resolver of ambivalences by the introduction of new interdicts into our lives. The fire of a new no. The therapeutic is a releaser from the interdicts, a transgressive figure. The two are thus very closely related and it is their relation that is the chief concern of this book, and not an analysis of Weber, Marx, Freud, or any particular figure. They are pegs around which at times, given my lack of greater skills, I have hung my analysis. But they are important pegs, and they themselves have helped make the transition between the dominance of the charismatic ideal and the therapeutic anti-ideal.<br><br>In this period of transition, our would-be charismatics are better understood as terrorists. The relation between the transitional, modern notion of charisma canned in the sense Weber, as I shall show, canned it, and terror needs some preliminary explanation. Perhaps the best place to begin is with the suggestion that holiness is entirely interdictory. A moral absolute thus becomes the object of all. Holy terror is charismatic; our terror is unholy. For our charismatics are engaged in no wrestlings of angels, but, rather, with the obeying of demons. Jacob was a charismatic when Laban and Jacob took mutual pledges before the God of their fathers; Jacob swears by the fear of his father, Isaac (Genesis 31:53). What is this charismatic fear? What is holy terror? Is it a fear of a mere father; in a phantasmagoric enlargement, Freud&#x2019;s idea is silly. Holy terror is rather fear of oneself, fear of the evil in oneself and in the world. It is also fear of punishment. Without this necessary fear, charisma is not possible. To live without this high fear is to be a terror oneself, a monster. And yet to be monstrous has become our ambition, for it is our ambition to live without fear. All holy terror is gone. The interdicts have no power. This is the real death of God and of our own humanity. It is out of sheer terror that charisma develops. We live in terror but never in holy terror. Those are the only alternatives, as I shall try to show in the course of this book.<br><br>A great charismatic does not save us from holy terror, but rather conveys it. One of my intentions is to make us again more responsive to the possibility of holy terror.<br>To lead into an understanding of the difference between the terror in our lives and holy terror, the difference between charisma and therapy, the two alternatives we have before us, the most convenient object is the thought of Max Weber on charisma. That will lead us also, by the way, into the deepest tension of modern sociology as a discipline functioning to dissolve all inwardness. We turn, therefore, first to an analysis of Max Weber&#x2019;s thought on charisma. Weber&#x2019;s sociology of charisma embodies at its greatest the polemical thrust of sociology, its intellectualism, its high function in the process of rationalization, that dissolution into meaninglessness from which such a discipline as sociology cannot save us. This intellectualism is coupled with a deliberate detachment from responsibility that goes under the name of science. Of course, such an intellectualism can be a conservative force, as Weber noted in the case of the priestly rationalizers of written sacred traditions. Or, it can be conservative through its defense of the high social status and institutional responsibility of the professional rationalizers themselves, the sociologists. But, even so, the interdicts are generally reduced by reason to magic, and the attack of sociology, like the attack of its Protestant predecessor, is on the very animus of charisma, as magic. Weber&#x2019;s entire treatment of religion is utterly suspect, and I shall try to unfold the suspicions. Weber is himself the culminating expression, I think, of the Protestant pathos, which turns into evolutionism and progressivism, with its mystique of breaks with the established order as the highest expression of the intellect and of soul. This Protestant pathos, this mystique of breaks with the established order, is less than a revolution and more than a reform. It is that relentless lusting after progressive social change that characterizes the liberal era and leads straight into the Marxist pathos, with its generalized species man, who turns into an apparatchik and party functionary. The truest reason for beginning with Weber is that in particular through his reworking of the idea of charisma, Weber made the most genuinely honest soundings, as Karl Jaspers said in his memorial address of the human spirit in the contemporary world. Weber achieved a form of such genuineness that his work became the adequate expressio...</p><h2>The Golden Age of Yachting</h2><p>The Golden Age of Yachting is a book consisting mostly of yachting history, as the author felt and rightly so that a review of the past is the best way to make an introduction to the sport.

Although he hadn&#x2019;t seen Nate Bowditch for eighteen years, not since Rees had marched away with the Continental Army in 1777, as boys they&#x2019;d been closer than brothers. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; <br>Potter put down his cup with a clink. &#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m sure. His wife herself told me of his death.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never met her,&#x201d; Rees said. <br>&#x201c;After almost twenty years? He lives&#x2014;lived on the other side of Dugard, not the Atlantic Ocean. What happened? You were such good friends.&#x201d; <br>Rees shrugged; that story was too long to tell. &#x201c;We&nbsp;&#x2026; went in different directions.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nate has children, too, did you know? Two sons and a daughter,&#x201d; Potter continued, his expression stern. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;d like to know what happened to their father.&#x201d; <br>Rees expelled his breath as Lydia Jane entered with more coffee and cake. Potter cast her a glance, his eyes lighting curiously upon the square linen cap covering her dark red hair. Rees did not introduce her, although his eyes involuntarily lingered upon her face. He didn&#x2019;t know what to say. He&#x2019;d met Lydia, a former Shaker, when he&#x2019;d pursued his runaway son to the Shaker village of Zion this past summer. Although Rees had fallen in love with her, he was reluctant to marry again, but he hadn&#x2019;t wanted to give her up either. When she had nowhere else to go, he&#x2019;d invited her to stay with him&#x2014;as his housekeeper&#x2014;just until they sorted out their feelings. <br>Potter turned his attention back to Rees. &#x201c;It looks like he was beaten to death with a scutching knife, Will. It&#x2019;s murder. And the constable believes Nate&#x2019;s eldest son is the murderer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;His son,&#x201d; Rees repeated. He was still struggling to digest the news of Nate&#x2019;s death. Nate remained in Rees&#x2019;s memory as the laughing dark-haired boy of his youth, not a middle-aged man with a wife and family. &#x201c;Why does he suspect Nate&#x2019;s son?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They were always at loggerheads, those two,&#x201d; Potter said. &#x201c;Nothing serious, I&#x2019;m sure. But everyone knew. And Caldwell, with Richard in his sights, won&#x2019;t look at anyone else. The constable is a drunken lout and the crew he hires to help him is worse, tavern rats from the Bull.&#x201d; He paused and when Rees said nothing, went on in a rush. &#x201c;You know Caldwell will take the easy way, Will. Is that what you want for Nate&#x2019;s son?&#x201d; <br>Rees sighed. &#x201c;And what if he&#x2019;s guilty? Have you thought of that? It won&#x2019;t be the first time a son murdered his father.&#x201d; <br>Now Potter lapsed into a thoughtful silence, staring off into the distance for several moments. &#x201c;Yes, I know,&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;But if he is, I would prefer knowing you were the one to come to that conclusion.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If I look into this, secrets&#x2014;secrets kept by anyone with the slightest connection to Nate&#x2014;will come into the light,&#x201d; Rees warned. &#x201c;You live here, George. Do you want to know everyone&#x2019;s dirty laundry? Know all the little ugly things about the people you love? Including Nate?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nate was my friend. I want his son cleared if he&#x2019;s innocent and the guilty man punished. Besides,&#x201d; Potter added &#x201c;we have no secrets in Dugard. We&#x2019;re too boring and know each other too well to have secrets.&#x201d; <br>Rees shot his friend a scornful look. &#x201c;Everyone has secrets, George, large and small. Illuminating them will bring out anger and fear.&#x201d; <br>Potter shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll risk it.&#x201d; After a short silence, he said, &#x201c;Please, Will. You&#x2019;ll work impartially. I know that. Please. I&#x2019;d look upon it as a favor.&#x201d; <br>Now, although Rees thought to refuse, he couldn&#x2019;t. Without Potter, Rees wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to recover his farm from his sister Caroline and her husband, Sam. And he&#x2019;d loved Nate once. <br>&#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But not tomorrow nor the next day. We&#x2019;re still bringing in the hay, or what there is of it after Caroline&#x2019;s and Sam&#x2019;s poor stewardship.&#x201d; Potter nodded, and the two friends sat again in silence. Rees recalled the expulsion of his sister and her family from the farm a month back. An ugly experience. He hadn&#x2019;t seen Caro since then, but he thought of her every day with regret. <br>&#x201c;You had to recover your property,&#x201d; Potter said, reading his old friend&#x2019;s expression without difficulty. &#x201c;You had no choice. You had to do it for your future and for David&#x2019;s.&#x201d; Rees said nothing. After a pause Potter said, &#x201c;So, you never visited Nate?&#x201d; <br>Rees shook his head. &#x201c;I wish I had,&#x201d; he said. But the break between them had been so abrupt, he could never figure out how to bridge the chasm. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t he inherit the Bowditch family farm?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, but he didn&#x2019;t live there. Thomas farms that one. You remember Nate&#x2019;s brother?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Rees said. Thomas, a paler and younger version of his brother, had tagged after them like a shadow. <br>&#x201c;Nate may still own it.&#x2026;&#x201d; Potter stopped and thought. &#x201c;Well, no matter. Besides working the farm, Nate served as our local weaver and kept ten to fifteen of the local housewives spinning for him. He required a larger place with a separate cottage.&#x201d; <br>Rees heard Potter&#x2019;s reproof, but knew that settled life would not suit him. As soon as good weather arrived with the spring, the road would sing its siren song and he would pack his wagon and head out again. Born under the traveling foot, that&#x2019;s what his mother always said. <br>&#x201c;Good for Nate,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Do you know where it is?&#x201d; Potter asked, extracting a piece of paper from his waistcoat pocket and handing it over. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve written out the directions. I suggest you drive out first thing tomorrow; Molly is waiting on you and will not bury Nate&#x2019;s body until you&#x2019;ve taken a look at it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your confidence in my acquiescence astounds me,&#x201d; Rees said, not entirely joking. <br>&#x201c;Your passion for justice, if for no other reason, assures your compliance,&#x201d; Potter said, clapping his friend upon the shoulder. &#x201c;Besides, you loved Nate once. You&#x2019;ll want to do right by him.&#x201d; <br>Rees inclined his head in acquiescence. Guilt and regret could be powerful spurs. &#x201c;Yes, all right.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Rising to his feet, Potter added, &#x201c;David can manage the harvest. Hire help if you must. Molly will pay a goodly sum to save her son from hanging.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Rees cried, gesturing at Potter to resume his seat. &#x201c;I need more information.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to influence you with my opinions,&#x201d; Potter said, remaining upright. <br>&#x201c;How old is the boy? Tell me about Nate&#x2019;s wife. I don&#x2019;t remember anyone named Molly.&#x201d; <br>Potter sighed. &#x201c;I have an appointment, so I must leave you. Quickly, then. Molly is Margaret Brown. You must remember her older brother, Billy? She was the little tagalong, always at his heels, copying everything he did.&#x201d; <br>Rees cast his mind back into the past, recalling Billy and the sister who rode and fought as skillfully as any boy. &#x201c;The bootmaker&#x2019;s children. Nate married her, that little rooster in a hen&#x2019;s body?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. You&#x2019;ll scarcely recognize her now. She grew into a lovely and very feminine woman. And Richard, who is just seventeen, was born a few months early, if you catch my meaning, when his mother was but sixteen.&#x201d; Potter grinned at Rees, who nodded. Many girls stepped up to the altar, pregnant, at fifteen or sixteen. Potter clapped his tall hat upon his head. Despite the day&#x2019;s heat, he wore a cutaway swallow-tailed jacket over his pantaloons and glossy riding boots. <br>Rees, also standing, suddenly felt self-conscious in his rough tow shirt and loose breeches. At least he&#x2019;d dropped his old shoes with the stink of the barnyard clinging to them on the porch. Called in from the fields and fearing an emergency, he&#x2019;d raced in without stopping even to wash his face and hands. He followed Potter out to the porch and watched him mount his fine bay gelding. The law had proved a successful career for Rees&#x2019;s old friend. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do this for Nate,&#x201d; Potter said from his elevated seat on horseback. &#x201c;And you need this puzzle. Admit it, you crave a challenge. The four walls of this farmhouse must already be pressing in upon you.&#x201d; Without waiting for Rees&#x2019;s response, he wheeled his mount in a circle and galloped down the drive. Dust rose behind him in a cloud. <br>Rees remained upon the porch, staring into the distance until his friend was long out of sight and the dust had fallen back to earth. He still could hardly believe that Nate was dead. <br>&#x201c;Will you do it?&#x201d; Lydia asked, coming up behind him. <br>Rees turned and looked at her. She&#x2019;d left her home with the Shakers to follow him here and seemed to be struggling with the adjustment. She&#x2019;d been unusually subdued of late. &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the final favor I can offer an old friend.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You loved him, and when you love you&#x2019;re loyal,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Once you knew about your friend&#x2019;s death, Mr. Potter did not need to ask. And I think he&#x2019;s right about you. You&#x2019;ve been a bear with a sore head lately.&#x201d; Rees frowned in disagreement. &#x201c;Yes, you have. Don&#x2019;t worry. You won&#x2019;t be abandoning us. You&#x2019;ll still be able to help David with chores in the mornings and evenings.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Potter said Mrs. Bowditch promises to pay me enough to hire help.&#x201d;&lt;...</p><h2>Starseed (Humanities Research Association; V.14)</h2><p>When a personal tragedy destroys her hopes for fame as a dancer on Earth, Rain McLeod volunteers for the Starseed Foundation, a symbiotic lifeform that enables her to defy the laws of gravity in space.

As an audiobook reader of his own and others' work, he has won the Earphones Award and been a finalist for the Audie Awards. In 2008, he won the Robert A. Heinlein Award for Lifetime Excellence in Literature.</p>Sequel to Stardance, the Robinsons' combination of dance, aliens, and politics in orbit above 21st-century Earth. Morgan McLeod is a dancer at the end of her career who still desperately wants to dance. Her only option is to apply to the orbiting, gravityless, hollowed-out asteroid Top Step; here, she learns how to survive in space and ultimately seeks union with a red-goo symbiote from Titan, thus becoming a Stardancer, able to live, work, and create indefinitely in space. Her narrative describes her progress in close detail from the time she leaves Earth until her training is interrupted by a missile attack on Top Step, directed from Earth by fanatical anti-space, anti-alien elements. Morgan's lover, Robert, a Chinese who at once flees back to Earth, becomes her prime suspect; she will track him down and defeat the evil conspiracy of which he is a part by means of a sudden total gestalt involving all Stardancers. Some fairly convincing exposition, an overdose of Zen, and a tiny plot tossed in almost as an afterthought. The female characters giggle too much. Still, Stardance fans will want to investigate. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She speaks of sexual politics and family in a fierce, determined tone voracious in its opinions about freedom and responsibility.<br><br> The author engages in mythology and art history, musically wooing the reader with texture and voice. As she references such disparate cultural figures as filmmaker Lars Von Trier, Annie from the film <i>Annie Get Your Gun</i>, Nabokov&#x2019;s Lolita, Facebook entries and Greek gods, they appear as part of the poet&#x2019;s cultural critique.<br><br> Phrases such as &#x201c;the caustic domain of urchins&#x201d; and &#x201c;the gelatin shiver of tea&#x2019;s surface&#x201d; take the poems from lyrical images to comic humor to angry, intense commentary.

Revealing a long view of gender issues and civil rights, the author presents a clever, comic perspective. Her poems take the reader to unusual places as she uses rhythm, images, and emotion to reveal the narrator&#x2019;s personality.

I thought I was sitting down to read some more somewhat confessional and yet somewhat abstracted poems about life in the first world. And then I realized I was reading a scathing critique of the niceties of this tradition that was drawing from second wave feminists, such as Ana Mendieta and Valerie Solanas. (&#x2018;Part-Cesaire, part-Solanas, part blood-sweat-and-tears.&#x2019;) The devil here just might be feminism, the devil we all need.

But her poems defy easy comparisons with their verbal dexterity, intellectual savvy, and fleshy insistence.

Reissue.</p><p>Unlike the Graces of Greek mythology, the ones in Patricia Gaffney's feel-good novel, <i>The Saving Graces</i>, are not in the business of dispensing charm and beauty. Though they possess some measure of good looks, Gaffney's Graces are more focused on the less ethereal problems of life: men, careers, babies, death. And there are four, rather than three, of them (Emma, Rudy, Lee, and Isabel), who have been getting together for regular dinners in their Washington, D.C., homes for 10 years.<p> The narration of <i>The Saving Graces</i> rotates among the four women and gets right to the heart of each Grace--the stories they tell stick close to the territory of their emotional lives. This intimate directness makes Gaffney's women seem, well, womanly. Serene Isabel, who has always been "the best champion, the kindest friend" to all the other Graces, is dying of breast cancer. Rudy needs to leave her ultra-controlling husband. Lee, usually the rational one, is possessed by her desire to have a baby. Ironic Emma wants to write a novel and has a hard crush on a married man. This group feels messy and real: they keep secrets from each other, grate on one another's nerves, and analyze each other. But ultimately, all four know that they've lucked into a very good thing. Not just because they share the sweetness and silliness that comes with friendship, but also because they are willing to act as soldiers for each other. When Rudy finally gets up the nerve to leave her husband, for example, she doesn't do it alone: "Isabel stood on my right, Lee on my left. Emma had taken a seat on the bed--an escalation of the offense, usurping more enemy territory." In Gaffney's universe, women armed with grace, humor, and a couple of good girlfriends can transcend even the most painful events in their lives. <i>--Katherine Anderson</i></p>Friendship sustains and enriches women's lives in ways no romantic or family relationship ever can. Now, in this wonderfully warm, humorous, and moving novel, Patricia Gaffney paints a rich portrait of this sometimes delicate yet resilient bond through the lives of four charming, vividly real women you'll swear you know--women who will become old friends you'll always remember.<br><br>For ten years, Emma, Rudy, Lee, and Isabel have shared a deep affection that has helped them deal with husbands, lovers, careers, children--the ebb and flow of expectations and disappointments common to us all. Calling themselves the Saving Graces, the quartet is united by understanding, honesty, and acceptance--a connection that has grown stronger as the years go by...<br><br>Though these sisters of the heart and soul have seen it all, talked through it all, they will not be prepared for a crisis of astounding proportions that will put their love, loyalty, and courage to the ultimate test.<br><br>Captivating from the first chapter to the last, this mesmerizing story illuminates the emotional links that define and join us as women.

Now the biography is available for the first time in a lively and accessible abridgment by the author. This is the quintessence of Shaw. The narrative has a new verve and pace, and the light and shade of Shaw's world are more dramatically revealed as Holroyd counterpoints the private and public Shaw with inimitable insight and scholarship.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playwright, wit, socialist, polemicist, vegetarian, and irresistible charmer, Bernard Shaw was the most controversial literary figure of his age, the scourge of Victorian values and middle-class pretensions. Born in Dublin in 1856, he grew up there, a lonely child in an unsettling m�nage � trois. His father, George Carr Shaw, had turned to drink, and his mother was muse to a Svengali-like music teacher whom she followed to London. The young Shaw, anxious to escape his heritage, also left for London to reinvent himself as the legendary G.B.S.--novelist, lover, politician, music critic, and finally playwright. From his first passionate affair with a beautiful middle-aged widow, he moved on to flirtations and liaisons with young actresses and socialists before finally settling into marriage in 1898.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the turn of the century, Shaw was in his prime, a theatrical impresario and author of those great campaigning plays--Man and Superman, Major Barbara, The Doctor's Dilemma, and John Bull's Other Island--that used laughter as an anesthetic for the operation he performed on British society. By 1914 the author of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pygmalion was the most popular writer in England, and increasingly recognized throughout Europe and America. Though ready with advice to others on how to stay married, he fell painfully in love with two of the most dazzling actresses of the age, Ellen Terry and Mrs. Patrick Campbell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reluctant recipient of a Nobel Prize for literature and an Academy Award for his screenplay for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pygmalion, Shaw became an international icon between the two world wars, feted from China and Soviet Russia to India and New Zealand, though still contriving to provoke the establishment in the United States, South Africa, and Ireland. In old age he was vigorous and prolific, espousing many new and quixotic causes. He&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; revealed himself increasingly as conjurer, fabulist, and seer through his powerful late works, including Saint Joan, the Chekhovian Heartbreak House, the modernist fantasy Back to Methuselah, and the imaginative dream plays and political extravaganzas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covering almost a century, from 1856 to 1950, this unparalleled life of Shaw presents the magnificent&nbsp;&nbsp; double portrait of an age and of a man who was born fifty years too soon. Holroyd magically captures the essence of Shaw's protean genius in a tragicomedy that</p><p>Michael Holroyd is the distinguished British biographer of writer Lytton Strachey (whose life formed the basis of the film <i>Carrington</i>) as well as the painter Augustus John. But his voluminous biography of writer George Bernard Shaw--the author of <i>Pygmalion</i> (made into the musical <i>My Fair Lady</i>)--originally published in four volumes, is probably his masterwork. This newly abridged one-volume edition has the virtue of cutting the documentation--which will be missed only by other scholars on Shaw--and is aimed squarely at the general reader, who will find here an entertaining survey with a wide base of interest. Unlike other recent books on Shaw that focus on a single aspect such as sexuality or politics, Holroyd's apporach is general, and quite successful. One feels that the biographer has grasped what was important to Shaw at each crucial moment of his life. Thus the biography becomes a kind of companion to the life, discreetly pointing out features of interest, but never overimposing Holroyd's own personality, though there are some witty details inserted--such as those about Shaw's estate in recent years--that indicate Holroyd's dry wit. Although not short at 704 pages, there are no longueurs, and this book may be called Brit biography at its best, a must for literature collections.

Illustrated in full colour by Alex Aycliffe.</p><p>Nicola Moon was born in Bristol, but grew up in Yorkshire. She has worked as a laboratory research assistant and a secondary school science teacher. Nicola&#39;s first picture book was published in 1994 and to date she has had over a dozen titles published including, for Orchard, Lucy&#39;s Picture. Nicola lives in Wiltshire. Alex Ayliffe is a well-known children&#39;s book illustrator. Her titles for Orchard include the bestselling Dig Dig Digging, Emergency! Choo Choo Clickety-Clack! Roar! Snap! and her latest title Stomp, Dinosaur, Stomp! Her board book Boo Barney won the Sainsbury&#39;s Baby Book Award. Alex Lives in Hertfordshire with her family.Vision is only one means of experiencing one's surroundings, imply the author and artist of this affecting story. When Lucy's class gets ready "to do some painting," Lucy asks to work instead on a collage for her grandfather. Soft reds and blues predominate in Ayliffe's torn-paper collage art, which shows the girl rummaging amid cloth scraps for the perfect items ("She liked plunging her hands deep in the box and feeling with her eyes shut"), then sacrificing her outside playtime to collect "twigs, leaves, and two small feathers." In a final burst of creativity (though not a recommended artistic maneuver), Lucy snips a lock of her hair to simulate a golden retriever's coat. The pictured pooch is her blind grandfather's seeing-eye dog; examining her tactile portrait (reproduced on one of the final pages) a proud Grandpa observes, "It's the best picture I've ever seen." Both Ayliffe's expressive compositions and Moon's straightforward prose-which admirably presents a physical disability here without attendant emotion-convey Lucy's distinctive intensity; her example might well inspire youngsters to fashion similar projects.

He wrote more than thirty books, allowing him to reach a vast audience, and his works continue to attract thousands of new readers every year.

With his precise, but lively, British accent, he eases listeners into the mysterious world hidden behind the wardrobe. There the suspense and tension mount as Lucy meets Tumnus and Edmund the White Witch. With flawless accuracy York seems to sense the very timbre of the White Witch's horrible voice and the anguish of the kind faun, Mr. Tumnus. York knows, as well, how excited the children are at coming upon Mr. and Mrs. Beaver at the very moment the forest has become so mysterious and they need some sensible friends to help them; later still we hear the gentle power of Aslan, as well as his fury. Michael York gives to each an unforgettable vocal characterization that will surely live in our children's memories as the Grinch or Scrooge lives in ours. P.E.F.

Early documents indicate that 85 percent of the state - close to 30 million acres - was covered by prairie vegetation at the time of Euro-American settlement. By 1930 the prairie sod had been almost totally converted to cropland; only about 30,000 acres of the original "great green sea" remained. Now, in this gracefully illustrated manual, Shirley Shirley has created a step-by-step guide to reconstructing the natural landscape of Iowa and the Upper Midwest.<br>Chapters on planning, obtaining and selecting plants and seeds, starting seeds indoors, preparing the site, planting, and maintenance set the stage for comprehensive species accounts. Shirley gives firsthand information on soil, moisture, sun and pH requirements; location, size, and structure; blooming time and color; and propagation, germination, and harvesting for more than a hundred wildflowers and grasses.<br>Shirley's sketches - all drawn from native plants and from seedlings that she grew herself - will be valuable for even the most experienced gardener. While other books typically feature only the flowering plant, her careful drawings show the three stages of the seedling, the flower, and the seedhead with seeds as well as the entire plant. This practical and attractive volume will help anyone dedicated to reconstructing the lost "emerald growth" of the historic tallgrass prairie.</p><p></p><h2>Opium War, 1840-1842: Barbarians in the Celestial Empire in the Early Part of the Nineteenth Century and the War by Which They Forced Her Gates</h2><p>This book tells the fascinating story of the war between England and China that delivered Hong Kong to the English, forced the imperial Chinese government to add four ports to Canton as places in which foreigners could live and trade, and rendered irreversible the process that for almost a century thereafter distinguished western relations with this quarter of the globe-- the process that is loosely termed the &#34;opening of China&#34;. Originally published by UNC Press in 1975, Peter Ward Fay&#39;s study was the first to treat extensively the opium trade from the point of production in India to the point of consumption in China and the first to give both Protestant and Catholic missionaries their due; it remains the most comprehensive account of the first Opium War through western eyes. In a new preface, Fay reflects on the relationship between the events described in the book and Hong Kong&#39;s more recent history.</p><p>Until the 1830s, China was scarcely known to the outside world. When Europeans began to arrive in number in that decade, demanding of the Ching dynasty's rulers access to raw materials and to China's huge domestic markets alike, the Chinese resisted, but, in the end, unsuccessfully. England in particular sought a market for the opium, a crown monopoly produced in India, and it waged a brief war to press its claim--a war that won it that market, the ownership of Hong Kong, and entry into cities like Shanghai and Guangdong. The war also contributed to the eventual collapse of Ching rule. Really a footnote in history, the Opium War, then, had major consequences that color Sino-Western relations even today. Peter Ward Fay tells the story in this well-written, vigorous narrative.<i> --Gregory McNamee</i>"I know of no other study that gives such a first-hand sense of the western participants' actions and reactions during this period. By letting us look at nineteenth-century China through the eyes of the traders, missionaries, and officials who hovered outside of Canton (and then finally assaulted the 'Celestial Empire'), Fay creates a perfect cadre for a lively, wittily written account of the time. It is narrative history in the grand manner."--Frederic Wakeman Jr., University of California, Berkeley <br></p><h2>There and Back Again: In the Footsteps of J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s England</h2><p>Mathew Lyons traces the influence of England and its landscapes in J.R.R Tolkien's world famous novels. Written from both the perspective of an avid Tolkien fan and a historical/literary interest in mythology and the influence of the landscape on Tolkien's work, Lyons follows in the footsteps of Tolkien through England, identifying the places that most arguably influenced Tolkien's creation of "Middle Earth".<br></p><p>Like many adolescents, Mathew Lyons was obsessed by J.R.R. Tolkien's novels. But as an adult, he lost interest. Until, that is, he became a parent and began to explore Tolkien's world all over again. Only this time he discovered something different from the realm of fantasy and myth he remembered: he discovered Tolkien's England.<br>Tolkien always said his original intention had been to create a work that would celebrate England. But which England was he celebrating? And where was it to be found? From a wartime posting on the bleak Yorkshire coast to a youthful holiday on Cornwall's Lizard Peninsular, from a Roman temple on the Welsh borders to burial mounds on the Berkshire Downs, Mathew Lyons follows Tolkien's trail, seeking the English landscapes that inspired him and trying to understand the complex emotions that drove Tolkien to his creative achievement.<br>There and Back Again explores Tolkien's idea of England and his unique perspective on English history. It is as much about England as the making of Middle Earth. And it is about Lyons's own journey as a reader, too, tracing his arc from enrapture through indifference to a deeper understanding of where Tolkien's power as a writer lies.<br><b>Mathew Lyons</b> is a freelance journalist and writer based in London.

The regiment� drawn largely from freedmen and liberated slaves in the Middle Atlantic and New England states� served in Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler� s Army of the James, whose mission was to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond. From May to December 1864, the 4th saw action in the Bermuda Hundred and Richmond-Petersburg campaigns, and in early 1865 helped capture the defenses of Wilmington, North Carolina, the last open seaport of value to the Confederacy.</p><p>Citing recently discovered and previously unpublished accounts, author Edward G. Longacre goes beyond the battlefield heroics of the 4th USCT, blending his unique insights into political and social history to analyze the motives, goals, and aspirations of the African American enlisted men. The author also emphasizes how these soldiers overcame what one of their commanders called � stupid, unreasoning, and quite vengeful prejudice� and shows how General Butler, a supporter of black troops, gave the unit opportunities to prove itself in battle, resulting in a combat record of which any infantry regiment, black or white, could be proud.</p> (20110302)</p><p>Edward G. Longacre is the author of twenty-four books on the Civil War, including <i>Fitz Lee</i>; <i>Gentleman and Soldier</i>, winner of the Douglas Southall Freeman History Award; and <i>The Cavalry at Gettysburg</i>, winner of the Fletcher Pratt Prize. All three are available in Bison Books editions.Following his history of the Union Army of the James (Army of Amateurs), prolific Civil War historian Longacre now focuses on one regiment of that army in this admirable study. Recruited in and around Baltimore, Maryland, the 4th infantry was unusual among the U. S. "Colored" troops, as it was drummed up partly from free men and partly from slaves. The regiment was capably led by white officers, headed by Colonel Samuel Duncan, and its African-American NCOs, led by the formidably educated Sergeant Major Christian Fleetwood. Although the 4th spent a good part of the war on garrison duty, it saw enough combat in Virginia, particularly around Petersburg, to consider itself honorable combat veterans. Even so, despite the unanimous support of all the officers of the regiment, Christian Fleetwood could not obtain a commission. The 4th ended its wartime career at the capture of Fort Fisher and the subsequent fall of Wilmington, North Carolina; Fleetwood later became commander of the first African-American National Guard unit, in Washington, D.C. This latest entry from Longacre should please his fans; it certainly raises the profile of the neglected Army of the James. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Juggling for the Complete Klutz</h2><p>Introduces basic juggling patterns and variations for the beginner</p><p></p><h2>March Story, Vol. 4 (4)</h2><p>Born of tragedy, damned by desire<br><br>Among the quiet villages and towns of 18th century Europe, demons known as the Ill hide within the most beautiful works of art, sparked to life by the torment of their creators.

In <em>A Fine Brush on Ivory</em>, Richard Jenkyns takes us on an amiable tour of Austen's fictional world, opening a window on some of the great works of world literature.<br> Focusing largely on <em>Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park</em>, and <em>Emma</em>, but with many diverting side trips to Austen's other novels, Jenkyns shines a loving light on the exquisite craftsmanship and profound moral imagination that informs her writing. Readers will find, for instance, a wonderful discussion of characterization in Austen. Jenkyns's insight into figures such as Mr. Bennett or Mrs. Norris is brilliant--particularly his portrait of the amusing, clever, always ironic Mr. Bennett, whose humor (Jenkyns shows) arises out of a deeply unhappy and disappointing marriage. The author pays due homage to Austen's unmatched skill with complex plotting--the beauty with which the primary plot and the various subplots are woven together--highlighting the infinite care she took to make each plot detail as natural and as plausible as possible. Perhaps most important, Jenkyns illuminates the heart of Austen's moral imagination: she is constantly aware, throughout her works, of the nearness of evil to the comfortable social surface. She knows that the socially acceptable sins may be truly cruel and vicious, knows that society can be red in tooth and claw, and yet she allows the pleasures of comedy and celebration to subordinate them. <br> Insightful and highly entertaining, <em>A Fine Brush on Ivory</em> captures the spirit and originality of Jane Austen's work. It will be a cherished keepsake or gift for her many fans.</p><p><br><strong>Richard Jenkyns</strong> is Professor of the Classical Tradition and Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University.<br>Given that there are so many Janeites, this book is that rare case of a critical study that might be taken up as eagerly by knowledgeable general readers as by students. Oxford professor Jenkyns examines Austen's novels, particularly <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Mansfield Park</i>, and <i>emma</i>, elucidating how each demonstrates the challenges she set for herself. Because of what seems on the surface to be a fairly narrow range (in her own words, "the little bit [two Inches wide] of Ivory on which I work with so fine a brush"), Austen is sometimes taken by modern readers to be an unadventurous writer, but Jenkyns makes a convincing case that she was a true creative genius who was always experimenting. Frequent references to recent film and television adaptations add an extra fillip to his discussions. Not all readers will agree with Jenkyns' bias toward particular books, but his lucid and lively study makes even dreary Fanny Price of <i>Mansfield Park</i> seem worth another reading. <i>Mary Ellen Quinn</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

During this period of time, fabled Captain John Coffee Hays and his small band of Rangers were often the only government-authorized frontier fighters employed to keep the peace.</p><p>Author Stephen L. Moore covers the assembly of Texan forces to repel two Mexican incursions during 1842, the Vasquez and Woll invasions. This volume covers the resulting battle at Salado Creek, the defeat of Dawson&#x2019;s men, and a skirmish at Hondo Creek near San Antonio. Texas Rangers also played a role in the ill-fated Somervell and Mier expeditions.</p><p>By 1844, Captain Hays&#x2019; Rangers had forever changed the nature of frontier warfare with the use of the Colt five-shooter repeating pistol. This new weapon allowed his men to remain on horseback and keep up a continuous and deadly fire in the face of overwhelming odds, especially at Walker&#x2019;s Creek. Through extensive use of primary military documents and first-person accounts, Moore sets the record straight on some of Jack Hays&#x2019; lesser-known Comanche encounters.</p><p>For the exacting historian or genealogist of early Texas, the <i>Savage Frontier</i> series is an indispensable resource on early nineteenth-century Texas frontier warfare.</p><p><b>PRAISE FOR <i>SAVAGE FRONTIER VOL IV</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Moore&#x2019;s fourth and final volume of the <i>Savage Frontier</i> series contains many compelling battle narratives, but there is a wealth of social as well as military history lurking in these chapters.&nbsp;No one who is interested in the people and the problems of the Texas Republic can afford to leave these pages unread.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>James E.

This method was approved by Pope Pius XI as a way of holiness for all, so we can grow in holiness through unfailing confidence and childlike delight in God&#39;s merciful love. Again and again in this book, St Therese shows us how Little Way of love and trust comes straight from Sacred Scripture. This book belongs in every Catholic home, for Pope St Pius X stated that St Therese of Lisieux is the greatest saint of modern times.</p><p>St Therese of Lisieux (1873-1897) became a Carmelite nun at the age of 15, after having appealed to her local bishop and the Pope himself in order to be able to enter at such a young age. During her entire life, and especially her time in Carmel, St Therese resolved to do little things with great love. That is, she would perform the lowest and simpliest tasks out of pure love for God. Her spirituality, called the Little Way, was based on complete trust and childlike confidence in God. She spent nine years as a religious and died at 24 of tuberculosis. During the last two years of her life, she suffered overwhelming doubts against the faith, but persevered in her belief and in the performance of her duties as a nun. After her death, she was quickly canonized and was named patron of the missions in 1927 and, in 1944, was made the patron of France. Pope St Pius X declared St Therese the greatest saint of modern times, and Pope John Paul II made her the 33rd Doctor of the Church in 1997.</p><h2>The Day of the Drones</h2><p>Five hundred years after a nuclear disaster a civilization of black people in Afria believe they are the only survivors on earth.

Inventive paper engineering lends variety to the ways in which 10 sleepless teddy bears each tumble out of bed, while Richardson's frequent shifts in perspective transform the bedroom into a three-ring circus. Off to the sides of his cheerfully colored pictures, several bears joyride in a toy car; a cat, three mice and a tiny alligator chase one another in heated pursuit; the docile elephants next door, bathed and ready for bed, are bothered by the ruckus until they decide to join the party; the hands of a clock record the advancing hour; and an aquarium teeters precariously. Adults beware: children may want this cyclical story to go on forever.

On Christmas Eve the boy cries himself to sleep, and the mother sits down at their one remaining possession, a harp. As she plays and sings through the bitter night, the harp weaves the extravagant "clothes of a king's son." By morning the mother is "frozen dead" beside this legacy of her love. Millay's sure ballad technique balances the poem's sentimentality. The understated bond between the pair is affecting, but younger readers may find the mother's passivity puzzling, if not frightening, and the concluding fantasy confusing. What can, in the poem, be taken metaphorically, is rendered quite literally in the pictures: there is a pile of clothing, as real as the dead (though rosy-cheeked) woman. Peck's oil paintings are as sober and restrained as the somewhat morbid subject demands. By not further romanticizing the poem, Peck counters its melodrama, but the realism of the pictures makes the fantasy jarring. Good in themselves, the illustrations diminish the symbolic dimension of the ballad. --Patricia Dooley, University of Washington, Seattle<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.In Millay's disturbing poem, an unseen, adult narrator tells of his harsh childhood and how his widowed mother tried to stay cheerful for her son's sake. The two live in a bare room in the midst of a busy town, and the mother bemoans the fact that the boy has no suitable clothing. But as time passes, they suffer through a severe winter--and slowly starve. Their last possession is a "harp with a woman's head / Nobody would take, / For song or pity's sake." On Christmas Eve, the boy sees his mother weaving magnificent, child-size clothing in the harp strings. But in the morning light he finds her, "A smile about her lips, / And a light about her head, / And her hands in the harp strings / Frozen dead." The poem is an odd choice as the basis of a children's book, ending as it does with every child's worst fear. (A note by the poet's executor presents the verse as Millay's tribute to her own mother.) Peck's ( The Silver Whistle ) oil paintings present a pretty picture of poverty: the faun-like child has roses in his cheeks and a neat haircut throughout (though his mother lacks shears). It's difficult to imagine where this book will find an audience.

The change in the day of rest and worship was not merely a change of names or of numbers, but rather a change of meaning, authority and experience. Essentially it was a change from a Holy Day into a holiday. </p><p> From Sabbath to Sunday has the distinction of being the first book written by a non-Catholic ever to be published by a Pontifical press with the Catholic imprimatur (approval). The book has already been reprinted fourteen times in English and has been translated in several other languages. Hundreds of scholars of different persuasions have praised this book as a definitive treatment of the early history of the Lords Day. I received a gold medal from Pope Paul VI for earning the academic distinction of summa cum laude in my research and school work at the Pontifical Gregorian University, in Rome, Italy.</p></p><p>My background is rather unique. I was born and brought up in Rome, Italy, a stone-throw from the Vatican wall. For my college education I went to England where he earned a B. A. degree in Theology at Newbold College. From England I came to America for my graduate studies and earned a M. A. and a B. D. degrees at Andrews University Theological Seminary. Upon completing my seminary training in 1964, I went with my wife, Anna, to Ethiopia where I served for five years as Bible and History teacher. <p>In 1969 I returned to my native city of Rome to study at the prestigious Pontifical Gregorian University, where I was the first non-Catholic to be admitted in over 450 years of its history. At the Gregoriana I spent the next five years working toward a Doctoratus in Church History. I was awarded a gold medal by Pope Paul VI for attaining the academic distinction of summa cum laude for my class-work and dissertation From Sabbath to Sunday. </p><p>After completing my doctorate in 1974, I was invited to teach at Andrews University, a Seventh-day Adventist institution located in Berrien Springs, Michigan. For the past 23 years I have served at Andrews University as Professor of Theology and Church History. To be able to pursue more fully my ministry of research into vital Biblical truths, for the past 26 years I have taught only only from January to May of each year. From June to December I am off-teaching so that I can dedicate myself fully to research timely Biblical truths. The result of this ministry has been the publication of 15 volumes which have helped thousands of people around the world to better understand and experience Biblical truths.</p>"...to show how and why Christians moved their day of worship from Saturday to Sunday..." -- <i>Martin E.

Gleason Music Book Award for <i>Crosstown Traffic: Jimi Hendrix and the Postwar Rock 'n' Roll Revolution</i>. He lives in England.</p>Twenty years after his death at age 27, Hendrix's stature as an Afro-American musical innovator continues to grow. But until now discussion of his contributions has been limited to either biographical accounts or purely technical analyses. British pop journalist Shaar Murray'scq multifaceted study rectifies this by attempting to unravel the cultural contradictions that the guitarist embodied as a black performer with a white audience, who excelled in a genre that was popularized by whites yet rooted in a black musical tradition. Hendrix's catholicity crossed barriers within black culture as well: his sonic explorations with feedback and distortion paralleled developments in the Free Jazz movement but he could suddenly shift into the deepest, most primitive Delta blues, a language pointedly neglected by his black contemporaries. Clearly, Hendrix's achievements are broad-based and central to his era, as well as a daunting challenge to those wanting to digest his work whole. Shaar Murray (coauthor of David Bowie ) augments solid musical scholarship with astute social and historical commentary, and meets the challenge admirably.

He is at the cutting edge of modern life and modern British cooking. &#34;The Naked Chef&#34; has something for everyone - from those who want great food but want to keep it simple, to those who work for a living and don&#39;t have time to spend all evening cooking. It is about giving people confidence and getting them to feel at ease in the kitchen, even if they have never tried cooking before!</p><p>There are a few British television chefs, such as Delia Smith and Nigel Slater, who know exactly what viewers want. They cook food that is simple to prepare but looks and tastes delicious. That's probably the reason why the BBC appointed Jamie Oliver as the presenter of its series <i>The Naked Chef</i> (which airs on the Television Food Network in the U.S.). A working chef at London's celebrated River Caf�, Oliver cooks simpler versions of the fare you would find on the restaurant's menu. It's basically modern Italian food using ingredients that can be found by almost anyone who is reasonably interested in food shopping. Like the television show, the book is titled <i>The Naked Chef</i>. In Oliver's words, this sums up the idea: "It's basically stripping back to the bare essentials." He applies this to all his recipes--from salads to roasts, desserts to pastas. He doesn't use culinary jargon or time-consuming processes. In the book you'll find suggestions for ingredients to keep in your larder (pantry) and herbs to grow on your windowsill. Recipes include Warm Salad of Radicchio; Gem and Pancetta; and Beetroot Tagliatelle with Pesto, Mussels, and White Wine. There are also tips on how to cook live lobsters, how to make gravy, preparing dry beans for cooking, and how to make the perfect roast chicken. Several photographs accompany some of the recipes, with step-by-step instructions. Oliver's recipes for bread are particularly good--a tribute to his training at Carluccio's, the Covent Garden deli. This is the perfect book for anyone who doesn't want to spend much more than a half-hour preparing meals and is not willing to compromise on innovation or taste. <i>--Dale Kneen, Amazon.co.uk</i>This is the American edition of the #1 bestselling English sensation by Jamie Oliver. With more than 120 fuss-free recipes, Jamie adapts his favorite culinary masterpieces for American home kitchens with easy-to-follow techniques and ingredients that are widely available. Jamie has applied his &#34;strip it bare then make it work&#34; principle to all his meals- from salads to roasts, desserts to pastas- and has created a foolproof repertoire of simple, feisty, and delicious recipes that combine bold flavors with fresh ingredients. At the same time, he avoids culinary jargon and any complicated, time-consuming process that isn&#39;t justified by the end result.This is a book that will appeal to everyone.</p><h2>Retail Flower Shop Operation</h2><p>Used.

Becky's hilarious schemes to pay back her debts are as endearing as they are desperate. Her "confessions" are the perfect pick-me-up when life is hanging in the (bank) balance.</p><p>If you've ever paid off one credit card with another, thrown out a bill before opening it, or convinced yourself that buying at a two-for-one sale is like <i>making</i> money, then this silly, appealing novel is for you. In the opening pages of <i>Confessions of a Shopaholic</i>, recent college graduate Rebecca Bloomwood is offered a hefty line of credit by a London bank. Within a few months, Sophie Kinsella's heroine has exceeded the limits of this generous offer, and begins furtively to scan her credit-card bills at work, certain that she couldn't have spent the reported sums.<p> In theory anyway, the world of finance shouldn't be a mystery to Rebecca, since she writes for a magazine called <i>Successful Saving</i>. Struggling with her spendthrift impulses, she tries to heed the advice of an expert and appreciate life's cheaper pleasures: parks, museums, and so forth. Yet her first Saturday at the Victoria and Albert Museum strikes her as a waste. Why? There's not a price tag in sight. </p><blockquote> It kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it? You wander round, just looking at things, and it all gets a bit boring after a while. Whereas if they put price tags on, you'd be far more interested. In fact, I think all museums should put prices on their exhibits. You'd look at a silver chalice or a marble statue or the <i>Mona Lisa</i> or whatever, and admire it for its beauty and historical importance and everything--and then you'd reach for the price tag and gasp, "Hey, look how much this one is!" It would really liven things up. </blockquote> Eventually, Rebecca's uncontrollable shopping and her "imaginative" solutions to her debt attract the attention not only of her bank manager but of handsome Luke Brandon--a multimillionaire PR representative for a finance group frequently covered in <i>Successful Saving</i>. Unlike her opposite number in <i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i>, however, Rebecca actually seems too scattered and spacey to reel in such a successful man. Maybe it's her Denny and George scarf. In any case, Kinsella's debut makes excellent fantasy reading for the long stretches between white sales and appliance specials. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Rebecca Bloomwood just hit rock bottom.

He skillfully draws upon scholarly and journalistic sources to write a thorough, yet well-paced biographical narrative.

After receiving a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Political Science and a Master of Fine Arts in Cinema from UCLA (1968, l969) he spent two years as a copywriter for a small Studio City, Calif. advertising and public relations firm. His writing career began when August Derleth bought a long Lovecraftian letter of Foster&#39;s in 1968 and much to Foster&#39;s surprise, published it as a short story in Derleth&#39;s bi-annual magazine The Arkham Collector. Sales of short fiction to other magazines followed. His first attempt at a novel, The Tar-Aiym Krang, was bought by Betty Ballantine and published by Ballantine Books in 1972. It incorporates a number of suggestions from famed SF editor John W. Campbell. Since then, Foster&#39;s sometimes humorous, occasionally poignant, but always entertaining short fiction has appeared in all the major SF magazines as well as in original anthologies and several &#34;Best of the Year&#34; compendiums. Six collections of his short form work have been published. Foster&#39;s work to date includes excursions into hard science-fiction, fantasy, horror, detective, western, historical, and contemporary fiction. He has also written numerous non-fiction articles on film, science, and scuba diving, as well as having produced the novel versions of many films, including such well-known productions as Star Wars, the first three Alien films, and Alien Nation. Other works include scripts for talking records, radio, computer games, and the story for the first Star Trek movie. In addition to publication in English, his work has appeared and won awards throughout the world. His novel Cyber Way won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction in 1990, the first work of science-fiction ever to do so. Though restricted (for now) to the exploration of one world, Foster&#39;s love of the far-away and exotic has led him to travel extensively. After graduating from college he lived for a summer with the family of a Tahitian policeman and camped out in French Polynesia. He and his wife JoAnn Oxley, of Moran, Texas, have traveled to Europe and throughout Asia and the Pacific in addition to exploring the back roads of Tanzania and Kenya. Foster has camped out in the &#34;Green Hell&#34; region of the Southeastern Peruvian jungle, photographing army ants and pan-frying piranha (lots of small bones; tastes a lot like trout); has ridden forty-foot whale sharks in the remote waters off Western Australia, and was one of three people on the first commercial air flight into Northern Australia&#39;s Bungle Bungle National Park. He has rappelled into New Mexico&#39;s fabled Lechugilla Cave, white-water rafted the length of the Zambezi&#39;s Batoka Gorge, driven solo the length and breadth of Namibia, crossed the Andes by car , sifted the sands of unexplored archeological sites in Peru, gone swimming with giant otters in Brazil, and surveyed remote Papua New Guinea and West Papua both above and below the water. His filmed footage of Great White Sharks feeding off South Australia has appeared on both American television and the BBC. Besides traveling he enjoys listening to both classical music and heavy metal. Other pastimes include basketball, hiking, body surfing, scuba diving, collecting animation on video, and weightlifting. He studied karate with Aaron and Chuck Norris before Norris decided to give up teaching for acting. He has taught screenwriting, literature, and film history at UCLA and Los Angeles City College as well as having lectured at universities and conferences around the country and in Europe. A member of the Science-Fiction Writers of America, the Author&#39;s Guild of America, and the Writer&#39;s Guild of America, west, he also spent two years serving on the Planning and Zoning Commission of his home town of Prescott, Arizona. Foster&#39;s correspondence and manuscripts are in the Special Collection of the Hayden Library of Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona. The Fosters reside in Prescott in a house buFoster's Spellsinger series follows the adventures of Jonathan Thomas Meriweather, a law student and budding rock musician who's been transported to a world of talking animals. Here, his songs have a magical power, which he uses to aid his friend, the aging wizard Clothahump. Their latest challenge begins as an SF version of Kafka's "Metamorphosis": they awake transformed into crabs. Other such temporary changes offer them visions of their hearts' desires, switch their sexes, etc. It's all the work of a trapped perambulator, a powerful, primal creature that drifts through alternate universes, leaving changes behind it. Their struggle to free the perambulator and save their world is full of the usual Foster inventiveness, but the limited characters are wearing thin. This is one of the weaker entries in an amiable series.

When the water climbs to the rooftops, where will everybody go? To Grandma's house, of course, high up on a hill. Before long, the house is full ofpeople, chickens, ducks, pigs, horses, cats, and even a cow. There's only one person missing -- Grandpa!</p> <p>This heartwarming story by Natalie Kinsey-Warnock is based on a real-life event: the Vermont Flood of 1927. Watercolors by Caldecott Medal-winning artist Emily Arnold McCully capture both the sweeping drama of the flood and the comfort of a cozy kitchen filled with friends, neighbors, and good cheer.</p></p><p><p> Natalie Kinsey-Warnock is the author of sixteen distinguished books for children. These range from her first novel, <i>The Canada Geese Quilt, </i>an ALA Notable Book, to her popular picture book <i>The Bear That Heard Crying</i>. All of the stories have one thing in common: They are based either on the author's own life or on true stories passed down through the seven generations of her family that have lived in northern Vermont. </p> <p> When she isn't writing, Natalie Kinsey-Warnock keeps herself busy as an athlete, naturalist, artist, book lover, bagpiper, and rescuer of three horses, seven cats, and eight dogs. She and her husband live in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. </p>Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Set during the Flood of 1927 in Vermont, Kinsey-Warnock's story reveals the tangled emotions and disrupted lives produced by natural disaster. When Wren's Grandpa starts building his wife a new house on a hill, she insists that she has everything she needs in the farmhouse where they raised their eight children. Before the structure is finished, unprecedented rainfall swells the nearby river and drives the family into it. Soon they are joined by 20 people and a variety of livestock. Despite their losses, the neighbors bolster one another's spirits with stories and songs. However, Grandma and Wren cannot put aside their worries about Grandpa, who has not returned from trying to save his heifers. At daybreak, they set out in a rowboat and eventually rescue him from the tree where he is perched downriver. Relief and joy at their reunion overshadow the news of the destruction. McCully's illustrations run the emotional gamut from the panorama of houses swept away in the raging river to a bemused Grandpa gazing at the chickens, cow, and horses in his new house. Mary Calhoun's <i>Flood</i> (Morrow, 1997) and Jane Kurtz's <i>River Friendly, River Wild</i> (S &amp; S, 2000), based on more recent Midwest floods, also provide insights into the human toll of such events. With its distance in time, <i>Nora's Ark </i>offers reassurance that lives can be rebuilt with the support of family and friends.<i>&#x2013;Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State University, Mankato</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Written in a racy and accesible style it is essential reading for everyone interested in exploring our mysterious past. Most books written on the Druids hitherto have been by archaeologists specialising in the Iron Age, who have occupied a great deal of space trying to find things to say about the 'original' ancient priesthood. Most have then devoted a final section of their books to people who have called themselves Druids since 1700 - until recently with contemptuous dismissal. Hutton's contention is that the sources for the ancient Druids are so few and unreliable that almost nothing certain can be said about them. Instead he reverses the traditional balance of interest to look at the many ways in which Druids have been imagined in Britain since 1500, and what this tells us about modern and early modern society. In the process he achieves many new insights into the development of British national identities, established and 'alternative' religions, literary culture, fraternal organisation and protest movements. He also suggests new ways in which the discipline of archaeology can be perceived - which will delight some practitioners and enrage others.</p><p>Ronald Hutton is Professor of History at the University of Bristol. As well as several major works on the British Civil War and seventeenth century history he is also the author of the <em>Stations of the Sun, The Triumph of the Moon</em> (Oxford University Press<em>), Shamans </em>and <em>Witches, Druids and King Arthur </em>(Hambledon/Continuum)<em>.</em>"His [Hutton's] impressive book gives much food for thought about the processes of human invention that pay a part not only in druidism, but in so many other religious traditions." (<i>The American Spectator</i>)<br><br>"...a compact and lively account" (Gary Lachman <i>Independent, The</i>)<br><br>"...detailed but readable...hugely entertaining..."

Gilonne Perdriel, daughter of a nobleman who will not acknowledge her and a young lacemaker who died soon after giving birth, is apprenticed at five to the trade that blinded her grandmother. While Gilonne and her friend Michanteau are locked away from the world learning the arduous steps involved in crocheting lace collars and flounces, the persecution of Protestants gathers deadly momentum with the blessing of the Catholic court of Louis XIV. At the height of this religious strife, the girls are freed to attempt to eke out a living. Beautiful Gilonne secretly marries a rich Protestant, but pines for Ogier, an arrogant servant from her father&#39;s estate who makes his fortune in New France and returns to Europe as a nobleman. When her husband is killed, Gilonne and Michanteau build a thriving lacemaking business aided by a clutch of eccentrics ranging from elderly, gossipy blind women to bickering artists. While the romance tends toward sugary excess and the prose is too often weighty and stiff, this French bestseller is ultimately as enticing and intricate as the gossamer lace it describes.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)It is 17th-century France, where a rising bourgeoisie is gaining power and making fortunes, and Gilonne Perdriel owns her own lacemaking shop by age 15. Montupet spares us none of the sweatshop conditions that child apprentices to lacemaking endured, yet she succeeds in resurrecting a lost art whose patterns were once prized as the quintessence of culture. This French best seller combines all the elements of popular historical fictiona beautiful heroine who achieves success and romance by her wit and spirit; a hero worthy of the enterprising heroine; and a miscellany of amusing social types. Women are clearly the focus; men often disappear and reappear without explanation. A vivid portrayal of the period that will appeal to fans of historical fiction.

Genre; Illustrated.</p><p>Just in time for the 40th anniversary of its original publication, Margery Fish's classic gardening memoir has been published in the United States for the first time. Fish and her husband Walter, a former editor of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, bought a dilapidated house and two acres of limey clay in Somerset in 1937, fearing the onset of war. For the next two decades, they cultivated, pruned, and watered, with Walter providing the direction and the sense of order and Margery the flowers, the unstructured flora, and the wry observations. As in all of the best gardening books, Fish's memoir leavens technical information on gardening with memory and reflection. The book is above all the story of a marriage within the story of a landscape. Walter's lectures on the importance of structure, the distant war, the hardships of postwar England, come through slightly muted, like the outlines of buildings seen through dense foliage.A charming account of how Margery Fish &amp; her husband created a cottage garden from an overgrown farmyard. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Michael Pollan said: "Much more than a period piece, We Made a Garden is a gentle reminder that plants are only a small part of what a garden is.

In the late 19th century a widowed midwestern farmer with two children--Anna and Caleb--advertises for a wife. When Sarah arrives she is homesick for Maine, especially for the ocean which she misses greatly. The children fear that she will not stay, and when she goes off to town alone, young Caleb--whose mother died during childbirth--is stricken with the fear that she has gone for good. But she returns with colored pencils to illustrate for them the beauty of Maine, and to explain that, though she misses her home, &#34;the truth of it is I would miss you more.&#34; The tale gently explores themes of abandonment, loss and love.<p>"Did Mama sing every day?" Caleb asks his sister Anna."Every-single-day," she answers.

It was while Heintzelman was at Camp Verde on September 28, 1859, that a daring thirty-five-year-old illiterate ranchero named Juan Nepomuceno Cortina sent shockwaves throughout Texas by brazenly leading some seventy-five angry raiders into the dung-splattered streets of Brownsville. Tired of a clique of Brownsville attorneys, resentful of men he accused of killing tejanos with impunity, and determined to settle a blood feud with bitter enemy Adolphus Glavecke, Cortina initiated a war that would reverberate north to Austin and beyond to the halls of Washington and Mexico City.<br><br><i>Fifty Miles and a Fight</i> magnifies the brutal nature of the Texas Rangers, a portrayal not readily evident in other sources. Not only does Heintzelman, who was placed in command of the Brownsville Expedition with orders to crush Cortina, record his disdain and distrust of the Rangers, but also their indiscriminate killing of both mexicanos and tejanos. Heintzelman's journal, which reads like a Zane Grey thriller, provides a detailed and vivid account of the battles at El Ebonal and Rio Grande City as well as glimpses into the filibustering activities of the shadowy Knights of the Golden Circle, who were hoping to expand the Cortina War into a larger conflict that would lead to the eventual annexation of Mexico and the creation of a slave empire south of the Rio Grande. Heintzelman's impressions of his senior commander, Col. Robert E. Lee, are also noteworthy.<br><br>A real jewel of soldiering on the Southwestern frontier, Heintzelman's journal begins on a sunny and optimistic New Orleans day, April 17, 1859, with his family on its way to Texas, and ends on a depressingly cool and overcast December 31, 1861, also in the Crescent City, with secession fever sweeping the South and the nation on the verge of war.</p><p>JERRY THOMPSON, dean of the College of Arts and Humanities at Texas A&amp;M International University at Laredo, is among the best and most prolific historians of the Civil War in the Southwest.

Grounded in attachment theory, Attachment Parenting gives parents, therapists, educators, and child-welfare and residential-treatment professionals the tools and skills necessary to help these children. With an approach rooted in dyadic developmental psychotherapy, which is an evidence-based, effective, and empirically validated treatment for complex trauma and disorders of attachment, Arthur Becker-Weidman and Deborah Shell provide practical and immediately usable approaches and methods to help children develop a healthier and more secure attachment. Attachment Parenting covers a wide range of topics, from describing the basic principles of this approach and how to select a therapist to chapters on concrete logistics, such as detailed suggestions for organizing the child&#39;s room, dealing with schools&#39; concerns, and problem-solving. Chapters on sensory integration, art therapy for parents, narratives, and Theraplay give parents specific therapeutic activities that can be done at home to improve the quality of the child&#39;s attachment with the parent. And chapters on neuropsychological issues, mindfulness, and parent&#39;s use of self will also help parents directly. The book includes two chapters by parents discussing what worked for them, providing inspiration to parents and demonstrating that there is hope. Finally, the book ends with a comprehensive chapter on resources for parents and a summary of various professional standards regarding attachment, treatment, and parenting.</p><p>Arthur Becker-Weidman, PhD, is director of the Center for Family Development in Williamsville, New York and the coeditor of Creating Capacity for Attachment: Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy in the Treatment of Trauma-Attachment Disorders, 2005.

Gray, PhD, diplomate, American Board of Pediatric Neuropsychology, and author of The Maltreated Child: Finding What Lurks Beneath)<br><br>The old adage is that it takes a village to raise a child. If that is true, then it takes a special village to raise a child with special needs. The collected wisdom of the contributors to <i>Attachment Parenting</i> weaves together an integrated approach to helping children heal from the effects of early attachment-related traumas. At the center of this special village is the critical role of the parent as the primary catalyst for and creator of experiences of healing. The concepts of Dan Hughes' Dyadic Developmental Therapy model provide the unifying principles, which continually foster empathic connection with the child and promote real healing. This lovely book offers both pragmatic suggestions and inspiration for hope.

Aird holds an honorary master's degree from the University of Kent and was made a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) for her services to the Girl Guide Association. She lives in a village in East Kent, England.</p>Robin Bailey is not a showy narrator. With his British accent and low-key approach, he matches the author's understatement and wry wit. In this first book of 18 in the mystery series, a slightly world-weary Inspector Sloan investigates the murder of Sister Anne, a nun found dead at the bottom of the convent cellar stairs. He must do so under the watchful eye of his pompous superintendent and with the sometimes dubious help of a young constable. Robin Bailey captures the essence of Inspector Sloan exactly. Fortunately for us, Bailey narrated several more of the Sloan series before he died in 1999.

Rustic architecture is the expression of an aesthetic concerned primarily with the informal beauty of the natural world. Often set upon craggy peaks, on cliffs overlooking wild seas, beside calm riverbanks, or in the depths of old forests, houses in the Rustic Style engage the eye and rouse the poetic soul by means of picturesque siting, evocative landscaping, asymmetrical architectural compositions, and often wonderful vernacular detail that reveals evidence of handmade work, including uneven floor boards, sloping ceilings, rough-hewn and textured surfaces of plaster, stone, rubble, and wood. In Rustic, Bret Morgan illuminates this much-loved style, giving us the definitive volume on the subject. Comprehensive in scope, Rustic features historically important houses from across America, some small-scale, some larger, from the sublime Ames Gates Lodge of 1881 in North Easton, Massachusetts, designed by H. H. Richardson, to the Arcadian masterpiece Ridge House of 2001, in Spokane, Washington, by Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen. A beautifully photographed and astutely written volume, Rustic is destined to become a much-cherished companion for those whose love of the woodlands is matched only by a love of home.</p><p><b>Bret Morgan</b> is a widely published architectural photographer.

The author, Egerton Castle, traces fencing from its roots in the unschooled brawling of the Middle Ages to its latter-day precision and refinement, focusing particularly on the 16th-century development of the rapier and the weapon's popularity in Renaissance Italy, where Italian masters founded the modern art of swordsmanship.<br>Envisioning the history of the sword as a history of humanity, the author proposes that the changes in modes of fencing corresponded to changes in manners. The rough, untutored fighting of the Middle Ages, for example, mirrored the supremacy of brute force in social and political life. The more subtle Renaissance era led to the ascendancy of the rapier and dagger, weapons of vicious elegance rather than sturdy brutality. Subsequent years saw a dwindling incidence of dueling, the decline of the sword to an article of gentlemen's apparel, and the reduction of swordsmanship to a courtly accomplishment akin to dancing.<br>"The subject is full of interest," the author notes in his Introduction, "not only for the fencer who looks upon his favourite pastime as a science, but also in a high degree for the novelist, the painter, the actor, and the antiquarian." All will welcome the return of this abundantly illustrated and long-out-of-print work.</p><p></p><h2>Edisto: A Novel</h2><p>A twelve-year-old boy chronicles his coming of age on a rural strip of coast between Savannah and Charleston</p><p><b>Padgett Powell</b> is the author of six novels, including <i>The Interrogative Mood</i> and <i>Edisto</i>, which was a finalist for the National Book Award, and three collections of stories.

He has received a Whiting Award, the Rome Fellowship in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Powell lives in Gainesville, Florida.<b>Foreword by Roy Blount Jr.</b><br> I love this book so much more than I do my stabs, so far, at introducing it, that I am tempted just to quote great chunks of the text, like the bit below. The narrator, after several provocative but inconclusive stabs of his own (brace yourself, in his shoes, for a bit of lore involving mayonnaise), reflects upon how he figures he will have to pick up, eventually, whatever he will need to know about sex: <br><br> . . . you can wait to know something like waiting for a dream to surface in the morning, which if you jump up and wonder hard you will never remember, but if you just lie there and listen to the suck-pump chop of the surf and the peppering and the palm thrashing and feel the rising glare of Atlantic heat, you can remember all the things of the night. But if you go around beating the world with questions like a reporter or federal oral history junior sociologist number-two pencil electronic keyout asshole, all the answers will go back into mystery like fiddlers into pluff mud. <br><br> The peppering is sand being blown against the house, the fiddlers are little crabs that skitter around on the beach. You can imagine pluff mud by the sound of the word. It just hit me, just now, how much all those sound effects, together with the rising glare of heat, are all anybody needs to know, or anyway sense, about sex. <br> <i>Edisto</i> is rich in sonic value, not only in the characters&#x2019; speech (three disparate examples): <br><br> &#x201c;Say whah?&#x201d; Very high.<br> . . . <br><br> &#x201c;What <i>choo</i> worrit about?&#x201d;<br> . . . <br><br> &#x201c;Sock, balloon,&#x201d; he said, in that kind of Jewish resigning whine they do on TV. <br><br> But also in how the narrative moves, how visual effects are almost sound effects and vice versa, as in this quick sketch of an air conditioner&#x2019;s demise: <br><br> The first season, the first hint of a hurricane . . . that was it for the Carrier. <i>Gihhhjjjjj</i> POW&#x2015;magnesium flares, house trying to hop up and run away on its stilts, transformer blown off the pole by the hard road (you could hear it), and no power for three days anywhere out here. <br><br> It will take you a while to get your bearings in <i>Edisto</i>, and that is appropriate, since the narrator, Simons Manigault, twelve years old, is trying to get his bearings. &#x201c;I seemed to be snapping-to about one or two months late. I was a reader turning pages written some time ago, discovering what happened next.&#x201d; This is a book about the reading and the writing of itself, but in a good way, a droll sort of way that is so organic you don&#x2019;t have to think about it except, as I mentioned, it might help you get a grip on the issue of its bearings. It&#x2019;s a book about growing up and living on a dying strip of America and about race relations and family relations. And Simons (pronounced Simmons) is a deeply likeable and reliable, extraordinarily non-emo, teller of his tale. His parents are estranged, alcoholic, promiscuous, and by no means conventionally nurturing; but he <i>appreciates</i> them. With reason, which he has the wits to realize. And he has the poise to hang, credibly, in an old-school African American dive. <br> If I were willing to drag you even more deeply into discourse less interesting than <i>Edisto</i> itself, I would go on at some length about other kids who serve as narrative foci of distinguished fiction: Holden Caulfield, who is mannered; David Copperfield, who is flat; and Maisie of <i>What Maisie Knew</i>, who is surely unlike any actual child even including Henry James himself when he was one, assuming he was. In his preface to that creepy (but in a good way) novella, James says a lot about freshness. Our boy Simons is fresh, and so is this book. <br> If I haven't mentioned Padgett Powell yet, I do so now belatedly. He is the author. He has been justly acclaimed. This first book of his was a great success (great as in <i>oh yeah</i>, not great as in some condescending heavy-handed unreadable unwittingly white-centric blockbuster such as <i>The Help</i>, to which it otherwise might invite comparison) when it first came out thirty-three years ago. As a writer I was envious of <i>Edisto</i> then and am envious of it now. As just myself the reader, I love going back over it, picking up on highlights anew. The foot in the sweet potato. The not-just-period aptness, <i>passim</i>, of the word <i>Negro</i>. The elephant and monkey joke, goes by you if you blink. Renditions like <i>thuther</i> and <i>roundbunction</i>. The mullet-fishing set-piece, oh my God. Hemingway did fishing, yes. Melville did fishing, no doubt. And mullet has not gone entirely unheralded elsewhere in American letters. But no one, to my knowledge, has done mullet <i>fishing&#x2015;by hook and worms</i>&#x2015;like Powell. It&#x2019;s not the fish, not <i>just</i> the fish, it&#x2019;s the people, and their ways. <br> This is the funniest damn book, and so adroit (&#x201c;the Boy Act,&#x201d; is it?), and so serious, so full of unforced heart. <br><br> &#x2015;Roy Blount Jr.</p><h2>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Ultimate Collection Volume 2 (TMNT Ultimate Collection)</h2><p><ul> <li>The classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action continues in the second volume of IDW's <i>Ultimate Collections</i>!

A poor elderly man has only his beloved rooster for company. One day, however, he speaks harshly to him, and the bird leaves "not knowing or caring where he went." He finds a small purse of coins but a greedy nobleman steals it. The rooster runs after the rich man, who tries to drown, burn, starve, and trample the rooster, but the fowl keeps finding a way out of each situation, growing larger as he swallows his enemy's treasure and cattle. The rooster finally regains the coin purse. He returns to the old man, who greets him with joy, and the two live richly, and happily ever after. The fast-paced action and a repeated refrain ("Cucurigu, my great lord!/Give back the pennies you stole") will grab readers' attention. The language flows smoothly and reads aloud well. The large folk-art paintings, done in watercolors and colored pencils, depict brightly clothed characters, detailed backdrops, and a hero who grows in stature along with his deeds.<i>-Janet M.

LAWNBOY is about the possibility of finding connection in a world of broken relationships and decaying motels -- the urban, artificial landscape of South Florida, as lush and troubling as Evan&#39;s imagination.</p><p>Paul Lisicky&#39;s stories and essays have appeared in Boulevard, Nerve, Sonora Review, Quarterly West, Gulf Coast, and other magazines and anthologies.

They didn't know about my old train set in my bedroom, complete with Cape Cods, hotels, signal crossings, and papier-mache palms, a set that I tinkered with until the ninth grade, then smashed--to my uttermost sorrow--after a fight with my father. They didn't know I could recite a handful of psalms--the 13th, the 23rd, the 42nd, the 53rd--completely by heart. They didn't know about my deep interest in Greek myth, my faith in the shifting weather, my fascination with Saturn and the outer planets. They didn't know that I spent hours at a time inside a concrete pipe, a cool, cramped cylinder in the middle of a field, whenever I needed to get away. They didn't know about the morning in my thirteenth year when out of sheer boredom, I stitched my fingertips together with needle and thread, making an intricate basket of my hand and giving myself a tremendous infection. They all thought I was good-natured, upright and responsible, gener! ! ous, affectionate, and kind, and of course I could be those things, but there was much more to me than that, a side that unnerved even myself, and this side included William. <p>William. William the pigeon-toed, William the conqueror. His name, though banal, still conjures up an otherworldly thing, not a being of flesh and blood. For a while I kept him hidden from everyone--my mother, my father, Peter. It even took me months to tell my best friend Jane about him, though she thought she knew me. Well, she didn't. </p><p>I liked to keep him that way: my secret path, my own private joy.</p></p><h2>Living the Message: Daily Reflections with Eugene Peterson</h2><p>Eugene Peterson, distinguished translator of the acclaimed The Message: The New Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs, offers a daily spiritual companion that brings God&#39;s message to vivid life each and every day.

Following the Italian surrender in September 1943, a number of aces continued to take the fight to the Allies as part of the Luftwaffe-run ANR, which was equipped with far more potent equipment such as the Bf 109G, Macchi 205V and Fiat G.55.

This is a very clear and easily readable volume that I'm sure can be very helpful for those either pursuing a spiritual journey or for those recovering from a spiritual catastrophe.

Thanks for the book. Let's hope it's going to be a winner--and it should be, as you have some excellent material in there. For one thing, it is unique--so far as I know, and I do try to keep up with the literature-- in that you present a very frank discussion of the problem of the "embarrassment of enlightenment." That is something that needed to be said. The concept of enlightenment as loss is new to me, but made a strong impression because afterward I thought about it and realized that it must be so: enlightenment cannot be anything but loss because it is by letting go, giving up, that we get there. Yes, very good. </p><p>Yours in the Dhamma, Al Reed 1566 South Dover Court Denver, Colorado 80232 </p><p> *********************** </p><p>Thanks for Saints &amp; Psychopaths.

He lives in the Pacific Northwest.The "double tap" of the title refers both to ballistics evidence--two shots, only an inch apart, to the victim's head--and to the way wars have of reaching out to veterans, spattering past trauma into the present. Martini's latest legal thriller starring California defense attorney Paul Madriani weaves the theme of the past infiltrating the present throughout a daunting case. The body of an extremely wealthy businesswoman, CEO of a corporation specializing in defense, is found with two tightly grouped bullet wounds to the head, suggesting the work of an expert marksman. Enter the most likely suspect: a career soldier who was on the victim's security detail and with whom she was having an affair. As Madriani attempts to defend the uncooperative soldier, he discovers that the victim's company was involved in a potentially devastating antiterrorist program. The plot progresses in a satisfyingly logical way, from first interview with the suspect through legal machinations and on to a tense, utterly believable courtroom battle. Plot and legal knowledge are Martini's strength. Dialogue, however, is his weakness. Characters continually deliver off-the-cuff, incredibly detailed descriptions of scenes that seem much more writerly than conversational. And Martini is often guilty of overdescription--three pages of the businesswoman handing her keys to a valet parking attendant. Still, in this case, the plot carries the prose. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The only difference between grown-ups and kids is that grown-ups go to jail for murder.

It's so hot that the backs of my legs feel like melted gum, only stickier. We've been driving for days now; it feels like eternity. &nbsp; In front of us is a rusty pickup truck with a gang of dirty-looking kids in the back sandwiched between furniture--an iron bed, a rocking chair, battered pots--all tied up with little bits of fraying rope like a spiderweb. A girl my age is holding a baby that's got a pair of ladies' bloomers tied on its head to keep the sun out of its eyes. The boy sitting next to her has a gap between his two front teeth.

Primitive yet astoundingly intricate in their construction, these decorative objects are made through a process of layering elaborately notched pieces of wood to create ornate and multidimensional surfaces for boxes, picture frames, and other tabletop items, as well as full-sized furniture pieces. Created during the Great Depression by itinerants, tramp art was often traded for food. All of the wood used was scrap and discard, mostly from wooden cigar boxes. Though there were never any written instructions, the technique for construction was apparently passed on like a secret family recipe. <p>Tramp Art: A Folk Art Phenomenon and the resulting exhibition consists of newly discovered pieces, many of them rare and unique, all of them significant. The catalog will also include photographs of historic precursors to and European examples of the craft.</p>Tramp art, a style of wood carving that was especially popular during the early part of this century, is misleadingly named. Although some itinerant people practiced this decorative skill, it is more a sedentary folk tradition handed down from father to son. In tramp art, the artist uses a penknife to cut simple V-shaped notches into the edges of scrap wood, generally cigar boxes. The wood is then glued, layered, and assembled into utilitarian objects for the home, e.g., picture frames, jewelry boxes, and furniture trim. Until recently, tramp art was overlooked by all but a few experts such as Fendelman, a contributor to Country Living magazine and cohost of the National television program Treasures in Your Attic, and Taylor, a collector and professional photographer long fascinated with tramp art. The book is filled with high-quality color illustrations and contains everything known about the subject. Recommended for antiques collections in public libraries.ASusan M.

At the heart of the argument lies a discussion of subjectivity and class: the way in which the process of looking at the countryside reinforced the identity of the metropolitan bourgeoisie - and especially men.</p><p></p><h2>On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno</h2><p>Few record collections remain untouched by Brian Eno&#x2019;s aesthetic DNA: from ambient soundscapes and world-music hybrids to cut &#x2019;n&#x2019; paste vocal samples and amniotic chill-out rooms, Eno is all around us. A sonic alchemist to the stars, his address book is a veritable who&#x2019;s who of rock and his credit adorns an outrageous number of albums. Tellingly, Eno&#x2019;s work with Roxy Music, David Bowie, Talking Heads, Devo, U2, and Coldplay has coincided with those artists producing their most critically revered work.&nbsp;<i>On Some Faraway Beach </i>is the first serious, critical examination of the life and times of Brian Eno. David Sheppard has interviewed key collaborators like David Byrne, Robert Wyatt, John Cale, Bryan Ferry, and Gavin Bryars. But more importantly, Sheppard has had considerable assistance and input from Brian and Anthea Eno themselves, while retaining an edge and independence in keeping with his subject.</p><p><p><b>David Sheppard</b> is a practicing musician and a writer on music and culture in the UK&nbsp;and the author of <i>Elvis Costello</i> and <i>Leonard Cohen</i>.</p>"A&nbsp;valuable document of one of late-20th-century pop music&#x2019;s key influencers."&nbsp; <i> Publishers Weekly</i><br><br><p>"[An] honourable, authorized attempt to do justice to a mind-bogglingly restless and prolific subject. . . .

Trotsky&#x2019;s extraordinary life and extensive writings have left an indelible mark on revolutionary conscience; and yet there was at one time a danger that his name would disappear altogether from history. Isaac Deutscher&#x2019;s magisterial three-volume biography was the first major publication to counter the powerful Stalinist propaganda machine, and in this definitive work Trotsky emerges in his real stature, as the most heroic, and ultimately tragic, character of the Russian revolution.<br><br>This first volume of the trilogy, originally published in 1954, traces Trotsky&#x2019;s political development: his early activities, the formation and crystallization of his distinctive and motivating idea&#x2014;the permanent revolution&#x2014; his long feud and final reconciliation with Lenin and Bolshevism, and his role in the October insurrection of 1917. The volume ends in the year 1921, when Trotsky, then at the climax of his power, unwittingly sowed the seeds of his own defeat.</p><p><b>Isaac Deutscher</b> was born in 1907 near Krakow and joined the Polish Communist Party, from which he was expelled in 1932. He then moved to London where he died in 1967. His other books include <i>Stalin</i> and <i>The Unfinished Revolution</i>.&#x201c;In the 1930s, Trotsky, with a handful of followers, attempted to block the path of Stalin&#x2019;s relentless hurricane of betrayal and murder. His epic defence of the soul of the Revolution against its bureaucratic executioners was a torchlight in the storm. In one of the very greatest modern biographies, Isaac Deutscher redeems the legacy of this astonishing revolutionary and humanist thinker.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mike Davis<br><br>&#x201c;The three volumes of Isaac Deutscher&#x2019;s life of Trotsky ... were for me the most exciting reading of the year.

His work has helped to shape a generation of writers, theatergoers, and thinkers. His plays are studied worldwide as texts that changed the face of theater.<p>The Caucasian Chalk Circle is a parable inspired by the Chinese play Chalk Circle. Written at the close of World War II, the story is set in the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia. It retells the tale of King Solomon and a child claimed by and fought over by two mothers. But this chalk circle is metaphorically drawn around a society misdirected in its priorities. Brecht's statements about class are cloaked in the innocence of a fable that whispers insistently to the audience.</p><p>No translations of Brecht's work are as reliable and compelling as Eric Bentley's.

From the pre-Tudor navies dating back to Alfred the Great through the sixteenth-century reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, the author provides a detailed record of naval activities involving English ships, organized by monarch and naval campaigns. In addition, the book portrays the individuals involved and the inner workings of the Tudor navy's organizational structure.

Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, and Dorothy Parker. Pauline grew close to Hadley but eventually forged a stronger bond with Hemingway himself; with her stylish looks and dedication to Hemingway's writing, Pauline became the source of "unbelievable happiness" for Hemingway and, by 1927, his second wife. Pauline was her husband's best editor and critic, and her wealthy family provided moral and financial support, including the conversion of an old barn to a dedicated writing studio at the family home in Piggott, Arkansas. The marriage lasted thirteen years, some of Hemingway's most productive, and the couple had two children. But the "unbelievable happiness" met with "final sorrow," as Hemingway wrote, and Pauline would be the second of Hemingway's four wives. <i>Unbelievable Happiness and Final Sorrow</i> paints a full picture of Pauline and the role she played in Ernest Hemingway's becoming one of our greatest literary figures.</p><p>Ruth A.

In this engrossing novel, we follow Sherlock Holmes as he tackles his most difficult case. He must find Karl Marx's favorite daughter and return her to the house of her father. At the behest of Frederick Engels, Holmes undertakes the search for Eleanor that leads him into a world he has never encountered before, the fascinating Bohemian intellectual world of London in 1881. With his trusted friend Dr. Watson in tow, Holmes traces Eleanor's trail from the dark archives of the British Museum library to Klemscott House, where the socialists of the day meet. Along the way he encounters such laminates of the period as George Bernard Shaw, Beatrice Potter, and William Morris as they debate art and politics. Are the sins of the father visited upon the children? As Watson notes of Eleanor, "To look at her is to be reminded of Marx in his youth&#x2015;eyes alert and poetic, her spirit ardent and self-sacrificing, her intelligence extraordinary." But in what other ways does she resemble her father, and has her life been shaped by his? As Holmes gathers the evidence and follows the path of our heroine, it soon becomes clear to him that Eleanor Marx's fate, and the outcome of this mystery, may have been determined long ago by her father's philosophical stance and his very human failings. Eleanor is animated by her strong commitment to social justice, her idealism and love of humanity. Yet Watson senses "a premonition of...a child raised on fairy tales who would find herself inexorably impelled to disaster." Will this prove to be the case?Because of the personal and political ramifications of this case, Watson would not allow his account of this early but significant episode in the career of Sherlock Holmes to be published before this time. But it is here that Sherlock Holmes first confronts the evil genius of Dr. Robert Owen Mortiarty. For Holmes, it is the beginning of a lifelong battle of wills. This compelling novel describes their first encounter, and the penetrating insight and informed intuition Holmes brings to this case serves him, and the reader, well.</p><p><b>Lewis S.

Over the next eleven millennia, the oceans climbed in fits and starts. These rapid changes had little effect on those humans who experienced them, partly because there were so few people on earth, and also because they were able to adjust readily to new coastlines.<br>Global sea levels stabilized about six thousand years ago except for local adjustments that caused often quite significant changes to places like the Nile Delta. So the curve of inexorably rising seas flattened out as urban civilizations developed in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and South Asia. The earth's population boomed, quintupling from the time of Christ to the Industrial Revolution. The threat from the oceans increased with our crowding along shores to live, fish, and trade.<br>Since 1860, the world has warmed significantly and the ocean's climb has speeded. The sea level changes are cumulative and gradual; no one knows when they will end. <i>The Attacking Ocean</i>, from celebrated author Brian Fagan, tells a tale of the rising complexity of the relationship between humans and the sea at their doorsteps, a complexity created not by the oceans, which have changed but little. What has changed is us, and the number of us on earth.</p></p><p>Brian Fagan is emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

This episode involves a birthday visit to grandfather's friend Axel, also known as Stretchit. Bringing along a special lunch, Stina and Grandfather rouse a down-in-the-dumps Stretchit from his bed, and celebrate with a friendly meal. The man then regales Stina with a story of his adventures at sea, in which a washtub plays a crucial role. When the unabashedly tall tale ends, Stina is made the proud owner of the washtub, just the proper boat she was seeking for her toy hippo. Before leaving, she and Grandfather sing a lullaby and tuck Stretchit back into bed. Young children may not connect Stretchit's nickname with his propensity for exaggeration, but, like Stina, they will enjoy his antics and Grandfather's benevolent, understated humor. Wonderfully expressive double-spread watercolor paintings exude the atmosphere of the seacoast, lying on the pages like scenes from a film. Little embellishments, like anecdotes, sit in the white margins alongside the text.

Less than three weeks before, on 22 June Hitler had unleashed his Wehrmacht's massive invasion of the Soviet Union code-named Operation Barbarossa, which sought to defeat the Soviet Union's Red Army, conquer the country, and unseat its Communist ruler, Josef Stalin. Between 22 June and 10 July, the Wehrmacht advanced up to 500 kilometers into Soviet territory, killed or captured up to one million Red Army soldiers, and reached the western banks of the Western Dvina and Dnepr Rivers, by doing so satisfying the premier assumption of Plan Barbarossa that the Third Reich would emerge victorious if it could defeat and destroy the bulk of the Red Army before it withdrew to safely behind those two rivers. With the Red Army now shattered, Hitler and most Germans expected total victory in a matter of weeks. The ensuing battles in the Smolensk region frustrated German hopes for quick victory. Once across the Dvina and Dnepr Rivers, a surprised Wehrmacht encountered five fresh Soviet armies. Despite destroying two of these armies outright, severely damaging two others, and encircling the remnants of three of these armies in the Smolensk region, quick victory eluded the Germans. Instead, Soviet forces encircled in Mogilev and Smolensk stubbornly refused to surrender, and while they fought on, during July, August, and into early September, first five and then a total of seven newly mobilized Soviet armies struck back viciously at the advancing Germans, conducting multiple counterattacks and counterstrokes, capped by two major counteroffensives that sapped German strength and will. Despite immense losses in men and materiel, these desperate Soviet actions derailed Operation Barbarossa. Smarting from countless wounds inflicted on his vaunted Wehrmacht, even before the fighting ended in the Smolensk region, Hitler postponed his march on Moscow and instead turned his forces southward to engage 'softer targets' in the Kiev region. The 'derailment' of the Wehrmacht at Smolensk ultimately became the crucial turning point in Operation Barbarossa. <br><br>Serving as both a companion to the previous three text volumes in this monumental study, and as a standalone battlefield atlas, this volume provides over one hundred specially commissioned color maps that trace the course of the campaign, each accompanied by a detailed caption.</p><p>David M. Glantz (born 11 January 1942 in Port Chester, New York) is an American military historian and the editor of The Journal of Slavic Military Studies. Glantz received degrees in history from the Virginia Military Institute and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and is a graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Defense Language Institute, Institute for Russian and Eastern European Studies, and U.S. Army War College. He entered active service with the United States Army in 1963. He began his military career in 1963 as a field artillery officer from 1965 to 1969, and served in various assignments in the United States, and in Vietnam during the Vietnam War with the II Field Force Fire Support Coordination Element (FSCE) at the Plantation in Long Binh. After teaching history at the United States Military Academy from 1969 through 1973, he completed the army&#x2019;s Soviet foreign area specialist program and became chief of Estimates in US Army Europe&#x2019;s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (USAREUR ODCSI) from 1977 to 1979. Upon his return to the United States in 1979, he became chief of research at the Army&#x2019;s newly-formed Combat Studies Institute (CSI) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 1979 to 1983 and then Director of Soviet Army Operations at the Center for Land Warfare, U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, from 1983 to 1986. While at the College, Col. Glantz was instrumental in conducting the annual "Art of War" symposia which produced the best analysis of the conduct of operations on the Eastern Front during the Second World War in English to date. The symposia included attendance of a number of former German participants in the operations, and resulted in publication of the seminal transcripts of proceedings. Returning to Fort Leavenworth in 1986, he helped found and later directed the U.S. Army&#x2019;s Soviet (later Foreign) Military Studies Office (FMSO), where he remained until his retirement in 1993 with the rank of Colonel. In 1993, while at FMSO, he established The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, a scholarly journal for which he still serves as chief editor, that covers military affairs in the states of Central and Eastern Europe as well as the former Soviet Union. A member of the Russian Federation&#x2019;s Academy of Natural Sciences, he has written or co-authored more than twenty commercially published books, over sixty self-published studies and atlases, and over one hundred articles dealing with the history of the Red (Soviet) Army, Soviet military strategy, operational art, and tactics, Soviet airborne operations, intelligence, and deception, and other topics related to World War II. In recognition of his work, he has received several awards, including the Society of Military History&#x2019;s prestigious Samuel Eliot Morrison Prize for his contributions to the study of military history. Glantz is regarded by many as one of the best western military historians of the Soviet role in World War II.[1] He is perhaps most associated with the thesis that World War II Soviet military history has been prejudiced in the West by its over-reliance on German oral and printed sources, without being balanced by a similar examination of Soviet source material. A more complete version of this thesis can be found in his paper &#x201c;The Failures of Historiography: Forgotten Battles of the German-Soviet War (1941-1945).&#x201d; [2] Despite his acknowledged expertise, Glantz has occasionally been criticized for his stylistic choices, such as inventing specific thoughts and feelings of historical figures without reference to documented sources.[3] Glantz is also known as an opponent of Viktor Suvorov's thesis, which he endeavored to rebut with the book Stumbling Colossus. He lives with his wife Mary Ann Glantz in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The Glantzes' daughter Mary E. Glantz, also a historian, has written FDR And The Soviet Union: The President's Battles Over Forei&#x201c; ... A necessary and valuable addition to the English-language literature on the Great Patriotic War. It includes a wealth of documents never before available in English, and it substantially revises earlier accounts of the Battle of Smolensk.&#x201d; (<i>Journal of Military History</i>)</p><h2>Sequential Spelling 3</h2><p>Sequential Spelling 3 is typically begun following Sequential Spelling 2.

Toscanini wanted to lay his baton down for the last time only after he had conducted a performance of it. Paderewski called it 'the greatest work of genius ever achieved by any artist in any field of human endeavour.' H.L. Mencken declared, 'It took more skill to plan and write it than it took to plan and write the whole canon of Shakespeare.'</p><p>And yet Wagner's many-splendoured comedy has come under severe criticism in recent years for what has been called its 'dark underside,' its 'fascist brutality,' and its 'ugly anti-Semitism.' In <em>Wagner and the Wonder of Art</em>, renowned opera expert M. Owen Lee addresses that criticism. He also provides an introduction to the opera and an analysis that will surprise even those veteran operagoers who may not have explored the work's intricate structure and the emotional drama at its centre. The book includes the on-air commentary that Father Lee gave during the first radio broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera after the events of 9/11. He thought it necessary, after attempting to refute the charges leveled against Wagner's opera, to say something about its truthfulness, its life-affirming music, its insight into the madness that can destroy human lives, and its witness to the importance of art for the survival of our civilizations.</p></p><p><p>'Reading Wagner and the Wonder in Art is the next best thing to attending a performance of Die Meistersinger with Father Lee himself.

James Holland On 18 June 1940 General de Gaulle broadcast from London to his countrymen in France about the catastrophe that had overtaken their nation &#x2013; the victory of the invading Germans.&nbsp;He declared &#x2018;Is defeat final?&nbsp; No! . . .&nbsp;the flame of French Resistance must not and will not be extinguished&#x2019;. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Resistance began almost immediately. At first it was made up of small, disorganised groups working in isolation. But by the time of the liberation in 1944 around 400,000 French citizens, nearly 2 per cent of the population, were involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Operations Executive (SOE) set up by Winston Churchill in 1941 saw its role in France as helping the Resistance by recruiting and organising guerrilla fighters; supplying and training them; and then disrupting the invaders by any means necessary. The basic SOE unit was a team of three: a leader, a wireless operator and a courier. These teams operated in Resistance circuits and the agents were given random codenames. The aim of this work was to prepare for the invasion of Europe by Allied forces and the eventual liberation of France. It was soon decided that women would play a vital role. &nbsp;&nbsp;There were 39&nbsp;female agents recruited from all walks of life, ranging from a London shop assistant to a Polish aristocrat.&nbsp;What linked them was that they knew France well, were fluent in French and were prepared to sacrifice everything to help defeat the enemy.&nbsp;The women trained alongside the men, learning how to disappear into the background, how to operate a radio transmitter and how to kill a man with their bare hands.&nbsp;Once trained they were infiltrated behind the lines by parachute or tiny aircraft that could land in remote fields.&nbsp;Some of the women went on to lead thousands of Resistance fighters,&nbsp;while others were arrested, brutally interrogated and sent to concentration camps where they endured torment and death.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lonely Courage tells their story and sheds light on what life was really like for these brave women who tumbled from the sky.</p><p>Rick Stroud has written: The Book of the Moon, The Phantom Army of Alamein, and Kidnap in Crete.

His left leg throbbed painfully, not only the tender, swollen tissue nearest the fracture in the bone but everything from ankle to knee, the muscles sore from too many days in stirrups, the skin chafed raw from the reluctant doctor&#x2019;s hasty splint. Grimacing, every movement a new torment, he propped himself up on his elbows and strained his ears to listen.</p><p>There&#x2014; a low whisper, quick footfalls, and, more distant, the jingle of spurs. And then, incautiously, two men arguing in hushed voices, one commanding, one pleading. A flicker of candlelight illuminated the shallow depression beneath the door of the tobacco barn, and&#x2014; e jerked his head sharply when a sudden gleam caught the corner of his eye&#x2014; the glint of a lantern appeared between the slats on the opposite side.</p><p>The barn was surrounded.</p><p>Blood pounded in his ears as he inched closer to his companion, grimacing in pain as he dragged himself from his makeshift bed on the hay strewn floor. Covering the younger man&#x2019;s mouth with one hand, with the other he grasped him by the shoulder and shook him awake. "Herold," he murmured, his gaze darting from the door to the four walls. "Wake up."</p><p>David Herold woke with a start. "What is it, John?" he whispered hoarsely. "Is Garrett running us off after all?"</p><p>Richard Garrett, the lean, grim- aced farmer who had welcomed them into his home earlier that day, had banished them to the barn upon discovering their true identities. Adding to the insult, he had locked them in to ensure that they wouldn&#x2019;t run off with the family&#x2019;s horses in the night. Had Garrett betrayed them to the men now drawing the cordon tight around their refuge? When put to the test, had the Virginia farmer&#x2019;s Southern sympathies given way to craven fear?</p><p>Rage flared up within John, hot and searing, only to sputter and die out, extinguished by hard, cold truth. It mattered not how their pursuers had found them, only that they had.</p><p>"Our pursuers are upon us," he told Herold, his voice preternaturally calm.</p><p>Muttering an oath, Herold scrambled to sit up, his short stature and fine wisps of facial hair making him seem even younger than his almost twenty-three years. "Should we surrender before they open fire?"</p><p>"I&#x2019;ll suffer death first." John pulled Herold close and added in a voice scarcely more than a breath, "Don&#x2019;t make a sound. Maybe they&#x2019;ll think we aren&#x2019;t here and go away."</p><p>At that moment, the plaintive creak of hinges drew their attention to the door, which was slowly, cautiously opening. A figure stepped into the doorway, thrown into silhouette by a distant lantern. "Gentlemen, the cavalry are after you." It was Jack Garrett, the farmer&#x2019;s eldest son, recently returned from the war. He had been clad in a gray Confederate uniform when they first met&#x2014; had it really been only the previous afternoon?</p><p>"You&#x2019;re the ones they seek." Jack Garrett&#x2019;s voice gathered strength as it probed the darkness. "You&#x2019;d better give yourselves up."</p><p>"John Wilkes Booth," another man proclaimed, emerging in the doorway behind Jack Garrett, a candle in his fist. "I want you to surrender. If you don&#x2019;t, in fifteen minutes I&#x2019;ll burn the barn down around you."</p><p>Grasping his injured leg, John drew himself up as tall as he could sit. "And who are you, sir?" he demanded, his voice ringing as it had from the stage of Grover&#x2019;s Theatre, the Arch Street Theatre, the National, the Marshall, Ford&#x2019;s&#x2014; the scenes of his greatest triumphs. He could triumph here yet. "This is a hard case. It may be that I am to be taken by my friends."</p><p>"I&#x2019;m Lieutenant Luther Byron Baker, detective, United States Department of War, and I order you to turn your weapons over to Garrett and give yourself up."</p><p>Herold, trembling and sweating despite the cold, took his head in his hands, moaning softly through clenched teeth. "You don&#x2019;t choose to give yourself up," he told John shakily. "But I do. Let me go out."</p><p>"No." John forced his voice to remain steady, his heart thudding in time with the throbbing of his injured leg. "You shall not."</p><p>As they argued, their voices low and heated, John&#x2019;s mouth went dry and a fearful tremor seized him. He was aware of Garrett speaking over his shoulder to the other men as he backed away from the doorway, and of Herold slipping from his control. Another ten minutes and the boy&#x2019;s terror would overcome him entirely. Before that moment came, John must sow enough confusion to conceal their escape, or all would be lost.</p><p>He seized Herold by the shoulder&#x2014; to restrain his companion as well as to brace himself against his own rising panic. "Surely we can come to an understanding between gentlemen," he called grandly, projecting his voice through the doorway to the officer lurking outside. "If I had been inclined to shoot my way to freedom, your candle would have made you an easy target."</p><p>Silence followed his declaration, and as he watched, the thin light wavered, shadows shifting as Baker carried the candle away and planted it on some hillock in the yard. Boots scraping on hard packed earth alerted him to the officer&#x2019;s return. "Give up your arms or the barn will be set on fire," the lieutenant commanded. A low growl of assent revealed his companions&#x2019; numbers&#x2014; a dozen at least, fully armed, no doubt, filled with misguided, righteous anger, panting to avenge their slain leader. John knew nothing would convince them that he had saved them from a tyrant.</p><p>In the diminished light, his gaze traveled the length and width of the barn, searching, hoping. There must be an escape, even now. He and young Herold could flee to Mexico, where Emperor Maximilian was offering refuge and substantial bounties to steadfast Confederates. There he would at last be proclaimed a hero, as he had not been in Maryland, Virginia, or anywhere in the ungrateful South. There, Lucy&#x2019;s studies of the Spanish tongue would serve them well.</p><p>Lucy, he thought, picturing her as he had last seen her, smiling and beautiful in the dining room of the National Hotel. Sweet Lucy. What did she think of him now? Would her love remain true, or did she too abhor him? Surely he could make her understand that the fractured nation owed all her troubles to Lincoln. The country had groaned beneath his tyranny and had prayed for this end, and God had made John the instrument of His perfect wrath. How bewildering it was, in the aftermath of the deed that should have made him great, to find himself abandoned by the very people he served, in desperate flight with the mark of Cain upon him, but if the world knew his heart, if Lucy knew his heart&#x2014; his courage faltering, he forced thoughts of his beloved aside. "My good sir," he called out, stalling for time, thoughts racing, "that&#x2019;s rather rough. I&#x2019;m nothing but a cripple. I have but one leg, and you ought to give me a chance for a fair fight."</p><p>"We&#x2019;re not here to argue," Baker shouted back, anger and impatience whetting the edge of his voice. "You&#x2019;ve got five minutes left to consider the matter."</p><p>"I don&#x2019;t need five minutes, Booth," said Herold, rising, clenching his hands, pacing, his anxious gaze fixed upon the doorway. "They got us cornered. We got no choice but to give up. Don&#x2019;t you see? We&#x2019;ve gone as far as we can."</p><p>John would not concede that they had, not while breath remained in his body. Again and again he tried to engage Baker in conversation, but the Yankee lieutenant would neither negotiate nor be distracted, insisting that the fugitives consider their circumstances and make their choice. Increasingly frustrated, John looked to Herold, who paced and gnawed his fingernails to the quick and would clearly be no help at all.</p><p>"Well, then," John called to Baker almost cheerfully, "throw open the door, draw up your men in line, and let&#x2019;s have a fair fight."</p><p>"Garrett," said another man, whose voice John had not yet heard, "gather some of those pine twigs and pile them up by the sides of the barn."</p><p>"What does he mean?" Herold asked, panic infiltrating his voice. "What are they doing?"</p><p>"Calm yourself." John strained his ears to detect Garrett&#x2019;s retreat, and soon thereafter, returning footfalls and the sound of an armload of pine boughs falling in a pile near the door. Alarmed, he shouted, "Put no more brush there or someone will get hurt."</p><p>"Booth." Herold backed into the center of the barn, gaze darting wildly, hands spread as if to ward off an invisible foe. "Booth&#x2014;"</p><p>"Herold, I told you&#x2014;" A whiff of smoke in the air silenced him, the crackle of new flame. Quickly he discovered the source&#x2014; someone had twisted hay into a makeshift wick, set it on fire, and shoved it through a crack between the boards of the barn wall. He watched, thunderstruck, as flames licked greedily at the wooden planks, steadily climbing, cutting through the shadows with garish light.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m going," Herold croaked, pale with terror. "I don&#x2019;t intend to be burnt alive."</p><p>As the younger man strode toward the door, John quickly reached out and seized the cuff of his trousers, gasping as stabbing pains shot up his broken leg. "Take another step and I&#x2019;ll kill you."</p><p>Herold gaped at him, his mouth open in silent protest, his pouchy cheeks quivering, his face eerily young in the rising light of the blaze. Suddenly John recalled how obediently Herold had served the conspiracy over the past year, how faithfully he had served John throughout their flight from Washington&#x2014; guiding him through the backwoods and swamps of Maryland and Virginia, finding them safe havens with sympathetic civilians along the way, risking his life in dangerous river crossings, tending John in his infirmity. John remembered, and he regretted his cruel threat.</p><p>He must save the boy, if he could not save them both.</p><p>"Get away from me, you damned coward," he snarled loudly for the audience outside. As Herold pulled away, John yanked him back again and added in a whisper, "When you get out, don&#x2019;t tell them what arms I carry."</p><p>Bewildered, Herold mutely nodded, stumbling backward when John released him.</p><p>"Lieutenant Baker," John called out, "there is a man in here who wants to surrender. He is innocent of any crime."</p><p>After a moment&#x2019;s pause, Baker called back, "Pass your weapons through the door and come out with your hands in the air."</p><p>"He has no weapons." John coughed and waved away a tendril of smoke scented with wood and tobacco and straw. A trickle of sweat ran from his temple to his jaw. "All the arms here are mine."</p><p>In a panic, Herold sprinted to the door, only to find it barred against him. "Let me out," he shrieked, pounding on the door. "Let me out!"</p><p>The door swung open. A soldier ordered Herold to extend his hands, one at a time, and the moment he obeyed, someone seized his wrists and yanked him out of sight. Before the door swung shut again, John glimpsed rifles and pistols trained upon the entrance, gleaming in the light from the burning barn.</p><p>The blaze had scaled the walls and spread to the rafters, roaring and crackling and filling the air with choking smoke. Scooting away from the walls, dragging his injured leg after him, John looked about for something, anything, to put out the fire. Instead through the cracks between the wooden planks he glimpsed the pale faces of Union soldiers outside, angry and curious, emboldened by Herold&#x2019;s surrender. They watched him with hungry avarice, like a vicious pack of dogs studying a cornered stag.</p><p>Resolute, he took his Spencer carbine in hand and reached for his crutch. If these were to be his last moments, he would not spend them lying in the dirty straw, helpless and despairing, so his enemies might watch him roast alive. As quickly as he dared, he pushed himself to his feet and steadied himself on the crutch.</p><p>He had nowhere to go but into the arms of his vengeful enemies.</p><p>Supporting his weight on the crutch, he made his way to the door, wincing as a shower of sparks flew too close before his face. The crutch slipped from beneath his outstretched arm as he reached for the latch, but he let it fall. He would face the soldiers standing, defiant and proud on his own two feet.</p><p>He drew himself up as he shuffled into the doorway, and raised his carbine&#x2014; and then he was lying on his face in the dirt, his head spinning, his neck trembling electrically as if in the aftermath of a lightning strike, his strong body strangely limp and heavy. He could not open his eyes, or dared not try.</p><p>He heard the faint thunder of quick footfalls, felt the strike of the soldiers&#x2019; boots on the earth transmitted through the ground to his forehead. Something warm and liquid trickled from his neck down his collar past his clavicle, over the old scar he boasted as a war wound, but when he reached up to brush the irritant away, his hand and arm did not respond. Dimly he puzzled over this oddity as the men gathered around him.</p><p>"Is he dead?" an unfamiliar voice queried, shrill with excitement. "Did he shoot himself?"</p><p>"No," replied Lieutenant Baker. "I don&#x2019;t think so. I don&#x2019;t know what happened."</p><p>John wanted nothing more than to riposte with a mocking jest, but the words eluded him, whirling beyond his fingertips like cottonwood seeds caught in a sudden gale. He felt them swirling about him, small and white and soft, thousands upon thousands, felt himself sinking into them as they mounded up around him on all sides. The crackling blaze faded, its light and sound growing faint, but the smell of scorched tobacco and ash lingered in his nostrils, a curious singularity that kept the white softness from engulfing him completely.</p><p>There were hands upon him, he realized, inquisitive and none too gentle. He had been shot, he heard someone say. They found the wound on the right side of his neck. Someone had disobeyed orders and had shot the most despised man in America, robbing the Yankees of the trial and execution they surely craved.</p><p>John felt himself rising, lifted roughly and carried away from the heat and light that flickered beyond his closed eyelids. He heard the crash of a roof falling in as he was placed on a patch of soft grass, his face turned toward the stars. Slowly at first, and then in a torrent, the blood rushed in his ears, and his head began to pound. He ached all over, his strangely heavy, frozen body sparking with pain.</p><p>He had been shot through the neck, he realized, vaguely astonished, as the last of the white softness blew away. He was probably dying.</p><p>He tried to speak, but he could manage no more than a wheeze, which was enough to draw the men closer. "Thought he was dead already," one muttered.</p><p>"He&#x2019;s on his way to dying," said another. "Hold on, he&#x2019;s trying to talk."</p><p>"Tell&#x2014;" John rasped. "Tell her&#x2014;"</p><p>A slim figure bent over him, lowered an ear close to John&#x2019;s mouth. "Go on."</p><p>John took a shuddering breath through the thick fluid collecting in his throat. "Tell my mother . . . I die for my country."</p><p>Nearby, a man cursed. Another spat in the dirt. "Tell your mother you die for your country," the slim figure repeated slowly. "Do I have that right...</p></p><h2>The Senate Watergate Report: The Historic Ervin Committee Report, Which Initiated the Fall of a President</h2><p>At the moment when the long-concealed identity of the Watergate scandal&#39;s most famous source, Deep Throat, has finally been revealed as former FBI deputy director Mark Felt, it is only appropriate that the historic Senate Select Committee report that helped trigger the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974 should be made available to a new generation. Here it all is: the break-in and cover-up, the wire taps, the dirty campaign tricks, the attempts to improperly influence government agencies, and the ensuing trail of lies and deceptions all laid out in painstaking detail.</p><p></p><h2>Pink</h2><p>Gus Van Sant is one of America's most original and celebrated filmmakers, whose credits include three films already considered classics: <i>Drugstore Cowboy,</i> which anticipated the current 90s revival; <i>My Own Private Idaho,</i> with River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves; and <i>To Die For,</i> a black comedy that was a critical and box-office success. With <i>Pink,</i> Gus Van Sant brings his unique and playful genius to the novel, and the result is both delirious and disarmingly tender.<br>In Sasquatch, Oregon, Spunky Davis, middle-aged maker of infomercials, is trying to find his next assignment, finish the screenplay that he hopes will bring him Hollywood glory, and deal with the death of his friend and favorite infomercial presenter, the teen idol Felix Arroyo.

But Jack and Matt are not what they appear to be--and are about to take Spunky to the mysterious realm known as Pink, where time and loss can be recovered.<br>With its riot of typefaces, footnotes and drawings (by the author), its trenchant and ironic deconstruction of youth culture and filmmaking, and its charmingly innocent sensibility, <i>Pink</i> is an absolute delight.</p><p>In the town of Sasquatch, Oregon, Spunky Davis, middle-aged maker of infomercials, is trying to find his next assignment, finish the screenplay that he hopes will bring him Hollywood glory, and deal with the death of his friend and favorite infomercial presenter, the teen idol Felix Arroyo. Enter two young aspiring filmmakers, Jack and Matt, whom Spunky finds strangely familiar - especially as Jack bears an uncanny resemblance to the late Felix. But Jack and Matt are not what they appear to be; they are messengers from a dimension beyond time known as Pink, and they invite Spunky to join them on their voyage of transcendence and recovery. Using every means the printed page offers to tell his tale - a delirious array of voices signified by different typefaces, a flip cartoon that animates the novel&#39;s action, footnotes, and drawings - Gus Van Sant turns the novel into an explosively visual experience, a captivating combination of texture and text.The director of Drugstore Cowboy, My Own Private Idaho, and To Die For turns to fiction with this self-indulgent fantasy about the horrors of Hollywood, the trials of filmmaking, and the sadness of young men dying. In a style most reminiscent of Tom Robbins (whose Even Cowgirls Get the Blues Van Sant brought ineptly to the screen), Van Sant indirectly mourns the deaths of Kurt Cobain and River Phoenix. In his whining, quasi-allegorical version, Phoenix is a young informmercial (sic) host named Felix Arroyo, who works for the narrator, a gay informmercial director called Spunky Davis. Davis, an ``overweight balding man'' from Sasquatch, Oregon, is working, in his spare time, on a screenplay (``$Great Skull Zero$'') about a bizarre sci-fi adventure that he hopes to see produced in Hollywood. ``Pink'' is the name of the alternate reality hyped by Spunky's two young friends, Jack and Matt, who remind him of his pal Blake, a rock star who eventually commits suicide, and Felix, who has also died. Jack and Matt insist that ``Pink'' is real, and that they have come from that alternate reality. They've traveled through time to reveal themselves to Spunky in a vaudeville routine involving nudity, a yellow bag, and lots of kittens. The two--who claim that they are in fact alternate, otherworldly forms of Felix and Blake--are full of New Age godtalk and general good vibes. Van Sant cheapens his offbeat effort to grieve his young friends (and imagine their lives on some other, happier plane of existence) with a number of gimmicky effects--amateurish line drawings, different typefaces, footnotes, and a cartoon flipbook in the corner of the pages. The grossest conceit is Van Sant's linkage of his own passing troubles and anxieties with filmmaking and the deaths of two young superstars--his rant against the tabloids seems particularly lame given his own exploitative tendencies here.

Arnosky describes the ways animals in nature camouflage themselves to escape danger. He explains how protective coloration helps woodcocks, owls, and moths stay hidden; how seasonal changes in the fur of weasels and snowshoe hares aid in concealment; and how the body shapes of speckled trout, snakes, and bittern assist them in blending in with their environments. Arnosky's distinctive watercolor paintings help clarify the text, and several invite listener participation. Large print adds to the book's appeal, though the reading level will be beyond the range of most of the intended audience. An excellent addition to primary nature units or pair it with Aruego's <i>We Hide, You Seek</i> (1979), Baker's <i>Hide and Snake</i> (1991), or Jonas' <i>The Trek</i> (1985) for the story hour set. <i>Kay Weisman</i></p><h2>The Luftwaffe: A History (Pen &amp; Sword Military Classics)</h2><p>John Killen&#39;s exhaustive work is a study of German air power between 1915 and 1945, from the early days of flying when Immelmann, Boelke, Richthofen and other First World War aces fought and died to give Germany air supremacy, to the nightmare existence of the Luftwaffe as the Third Reich plunged headlong to destruction. Here are the aircraft: the frail biplanes and triplanes of the Kaiser&#39;s war; the great Lufthansa aircraft and airships of the turbulent Thirties; the monoplanes designed to help Hitler in his conquest of Europe. Here are the generals who forged the air weapon of the Luftwaffe - the swaggering Goering, the playboy Udet, the ebullient Kesselring and the scapegoat Jeschonnek; here, too, are the pilots who tried to keep faith with their Fatherland despite overwhelming odds; Adolf Galland, Werner Molders, Joachim Marseille and Hanna Reitsch. Not least are the actions fought by the Luftwaffe from the Spanish Civil War to the Battle of Britain, through the bloody struggle for Crete and the siege of Stalingrad to the fearful twilight over Berlin.</p><p>JOHN KILLEN was born in Belfast and, up until his retirement in 2014, he was Deputy Librarian and then Librarian of The Linen Hall Library.

The Army leadership endured a severe lack of resources, political constraints, an indifferent public, tough environmental conditions, and other problems of the frontier. Army officers and men had to adapt to these constraints, and this period also proved to be a trial of the ability and endurance of the common soldier. This title details the organization, development, training, tactics and command structures of the US Army during its subjugation of the Plains Indian tribes.</p><p>Definitive guides to the actions and evolution of fighting forces, these comprehensive studies on the organisation, strength, command, deployment and evolution of forces in key military encounters, use a highly detailed &#39;unit-by-unit&#39; examination.Clayton K.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p><p>Born in Edinburgh in 1906, the son of the city's Director of Education, John Innes Mackintosh Stewart wrote a highly successful series of mystery stories under the pseudonym Michael Innes. Innes was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he was presented with the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and named a Bishop Frazer's scholar. After graduation, he went to Vienna to study Freudian psychoanalysis for a year and following his first book, an edition of Florio's translation of 'Montaigne', was offered a lectureship at the University of Leeds. In 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick, a doctor, and they subsequently had five children including Angus, also a novelist. The year 1936 saw Innes as Professor of English at the University of Adelaide, during which tenure he wrote his first mystery story, 'Death at the President's Lodging'. With his second, 'Hamlet Revenge', Innes firmly established his reputation as a highly entertaining and cultivated writer. After the end of World War II, he returned to the UK and spent two years at Queen's University, Belfast, where in 1949 he wrote the 'Journeying Boy', a novel notable for the richly comedic use of an Irish setting. He then settled down as a Reader in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford, from which he retired in 1973. Innes's most famous character is 'John Appleby', who inspired a penchant for donnish detective fiction that lasts to this day. His other well-known character is 'Honeybath', the painter and rather reluctant detective, who first appeared in 1975 in 'The Mysterious Commission'. The last of the Innes novels, 'Appleby and the Ospreys', was published in 1986, some eight years before his death in 1994. His work is still very highly regarded and 'Appleby's End' and 'The New Sonia Wayward' were chosen by H.R.F. Keating as being amongst the best 100 crime novels ever written. The 'Times Literary Supplement' said of him: 'A Master - he constructs a plot that twists and turns like an electric eel: it gives you shock upon shock and you cannot let go.</p></p><h2>No Man Is an Island</h2><p>A recapitulation of his earlier work Seeds of Contemplation, this collection of sixteen essays plumbs aspects of human spirituality. Merton addresses those in search of enduring values, fulfillment, and salvation in prose that is, as always, inspiring and compassionate. � A stimulating series of spiritual reflections which will prove helpful for all struggling to...live the richest, fullest and noblest life� (Chicago Tribune).<br></p><p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was born in France and came to live in the United States at the age of 24. He received several awards recognizing his contribution to religious study and contemplation, including the Pax Medal in 1963, and remained a devoted spiritualist and a tireless advocate for social justice until his death in 1968. The Sign of Jonas was originally published in 1953.Jonathan Montaldo interprets Merton's work on enduring values, fulfillment, salvation, and the relationship between faith and human spirituality. Montaldo conveys complex ideas with simplicity and an impeccable delivery. The first essay on spiritual love is considered a classic. Montaldo gives a polished performance when he reflects on man's relationship with God, man's relationship with others, and why love can only be kept when it is given away. Other themes touch on hope, conscience, freedom, and prayer. Montaldo's delivery of Merton's material on Christian humanism and reciprocal love gives the listener food for thought. This well-done series of spiritual meditations provides a wellspring of enlightenment and encouragement. Fans of Thomas Merton will enjoy the flowing prose.

As Kinew revisits his own childhood in Winnipeg and on a reserve in Northern Ontario, he learns more about his father's traumatic childhood at residential school. An intriguing doubleness marks <i>The Reason You Walk</i>, a reference to an Anishinaabe ceremonial song. Born to an Anishinaabe father and a non-native mother, he has a foot in both cultures. He is a Sundancer, an academic, a former rapper, a hereditary chief, and an urban activist. His father, Tobasonakwut, was both a beloved traditional chief and a respected elected leader who engaged directly with Ottawa. Internally divided, his father embraced both traditional native religion and Catholicism, the religion that was inculcated into him at the residential school where he was physically and sexually abused. In a grand gesture of reconciliation, Kinew's father invited the Roman Catholic bishop of Winnipeg to a Sundance ceremony in which he adopted him as his brother. Kinew writes affectingly of his own struggles in his twenties to find the right path, eventually giving up a self-destructive lifestyle to passionately pursue music and martial arts. From his unique vantage point, he offers an inside view of what it means to be an educated aboriginal living in a country that is just beginning to wake up to its aboriginal history and living presence. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invoking hope, healing and forgiveness, <i>The Reason You Walk</i> is a poignant story of a towering but damaged father and his son as they embark on a journey to repair their family bond. By turns lighthearted and solemn, Kinew gives us an inspiring vision for family and cross-cultural reconciliation, and a wider conversation about the future of aboriginal peoples.</p><p><p>WAB KINEW was named by Postmedia News as one of "9 Aboriginal movers and shakers you should know."

In this book, first published in 1988, Katon Shual presents some of the secrets of sexual gnosis within western magick - a system that is often misunderstood. The book begins with a look at the revival of sexual magick in the early part of the 20th century, especially within the ranks of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and some of the post Golden Dawn magical groups such as Aleister Crowley&#39;s Thelemic cult. The book goes on the look at the modern fusion of western Hermetic and eastern Tantrik sexual gnosticism. On the way it discusses in a progressive manner gay, straight and solitary sexual magick. The book goes on to introduce the ancient deity Seth as an archetype of the sexual magician. The book includes an unpublished grimoire of sexual magick, as well as several other unusual sources, including an authoritative exploration of the chakra system, a magical approach to kundalini and an introduction to the relationship between the sacred sexuality and the external landscape. &#39;Makes the subject of sexual magick accessible and lucid and above all relevant to contemporary magical practice&#39; - Phil Hine reviewing in Talking Stick magazine body magick cover art and insides by michael r goss</p><p></p><h2>Rats for Those Who Care</h2><p>Introduces different varieties of rats, and discusses the care and feeding of rats kept as pets</p><p></p><h2>The Black Stallion&#39;s Shadow</h2><p>When a tragedy at the racetrack leaves the Black afraid of his own shadow, Alec turns to eccentric trainer Wes Taylor for help.

Steven Farley takes over the series his late father began with this adventure in which the Black develops a fear of shadows. When he takes the stallion to horse trainer Wes Taylor hoping for a cure, Alec Ramsay becomes involved in trying to find the person responsible for a series of "accidents" at the Taylor ranch. The exciting conclusion connects the two story lines: Alec and the Black become the next targets, and the Black must overcome his fear of shadows to avoid a deadly accident. The plot is well crafted and provides plenty of thrills, but Farley seems to have lost sight of his audience. Young readers may not be able to identify with any of the all-adult cast of characters or follow their discussion of complicated financial dealings, unions, and the adult sport of horse racing. Parents and teachers can compensate by using the book as a read-aloud and providing lots of discussion. <i>Lauren Peterson</i>Grade 5-9?In the Farley tradition, the plot gallops off to a dramatic start?the Black and jockey Alec Ramsay win a race that leaves two challengers dead. The Black begins to spook at shadows on the ground, so Alec consults Wes, a movie horse trainer. At the movie ranch, he and his horse become involved in a mystery involving sabotage on the set. Plenty of action scenes and the glamour of the film industry will involve readers of this long-lasting series. Steven Farley, son of the prolific Walter, debuts with this title (the pair co-authored The Young Black Stallion [Random, 1989]). His simple writing style and fast-moving plot will satisfy those who've devoured previous adventures of the Black and his clan. (And yes, Alec does help his horse to conquer fear of shadows).?Charlene Strickland, formerly at Albuquerque Public Library, NM<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Interior Design Handbook: The Essential Planning Guide to Creating Your Perfect Living Space</h2><p>Whether you are moving into a new home or renovating and redecorating an existing one, <i>The Interior Design Handbook</i> is the perfect first step to creating an intimate and unique space that is a joy to love in and simple to maintain.

Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, Christopher is autistic. Everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning for him. At fifteen, Christopher&#x2019;s carefully constructed world falls apart when he finds his neighbour&#x2019;s dog Wellington impaled on a garden fork, and he is initially blamed for the killing.<br><br>Christopher decides that he will track down the real killer, and turns to his favourite fictional character, the impeccably logical Sherlock Holmes, for inspiration. But the investigation leads him down some unexpected paths and ultimately brings him face to face with the dissolution of his parents&#x2019; marriage. As Christopher tries to deal with the crisis within his own family, the narrative draws readers into the workings of Christopher&#x2019;s mind.<br><br>And herein lies the key to the brilliance of Mark Haddon&#x2019;s choice of narrator: The most wrenching of emotional moments are chronicled by a boy who cannot fathom emotions. The effect is dazzling, making for one of the freshest debut in years: a comedy, a tearjerker, a mystery story, a novel of exceptional literary merit that is great fun to read.</p><p>Mark Haddon's bitterly funny debut novel, <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i>, is a murder mystery of sorts--one told by an autistic version of Adrian Mole. Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.<p> Late one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--is <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.</i></p><p> </p><p> Haddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists. <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i> is original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read. <i>--Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca</i></p>"Mark Haddon's portrayal of an emotionally dissociated mind is a superb achievement. He is a wise and bleakly funny writer with rare gifts of empathy.&#x201d;<br>-Ian McEwan, author of ATONEMENT and AMSTERDAM<br><br>"I have never read anything quite like Mark Haddon's funny and agonizingly honest book, or encountered a narrator more vivid and memorable.

He is the author of &#34;Lord Valentine&#39;s Castle,&#34;Chapter 1<br><br> 1. Eli<br><br> Coming into New York City from the north, off the New England Thruway, Oliver driving as usual. Tireless, relaxed, his window half open, long blond hair whipping in the chilly breeze. Timothy slouched beside him, asleep. The second day of our Easter vacation; the trees still bare, ugly driblets of blackened snow banked in dirty heaps by the roadside. In Arizona there wouldn&#x2019;t be any dead snow around. Ned sat next to me in the back seat, scribbling notes, filling up page after page of his ragged spiral-bound book with his left-handed scrawl. Demonic glitter in his dark little eyes. Our penny-ante pansy Dostoevsky. A truck roared up behind us in the left-hand lane, passed us, abruptly cut across into our lane. Hardly any clearance at all. We nearly got racked up. Oliver hit the brakes, cursing, really made them screech; we jolted forward in our seats. A moment later he swung us into the empty right-hand lane to avoid getting smashed by a car to our rear. Timothy woke up. &#x201c;What the crap,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you let a guy get some sleep?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We almost got killed just then,&#x201d; Ned told him fiercely, leaning forward, spitting the words into Timothy&#x2019;s big pink ear. &#x201c;How would that be for irony, eh? Four sterling young men heading west to win eternal life, wiped out by a truck driver on the New England Thruway. Our lithe young limbs scattered all over the embankment.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Eternal life,&#x201d; Timothy said. Belching. Oliver laughed.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a fifty-fifty chance,&#x201d; I observed, not for the first time. &#x201c;An existential gamble. Two to live forever, two to die.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Existential shit,&#x201d; Timothy said. &#x201c;Man, you amaze me, Eli. How you do that existential number with a straight face. You really believe, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;In the Book of Skulls? In your Arizona Shangri-la?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t believe, why are you going with us?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s warm in Arizona in March.&#x201d; Using on me the airy, casual, John-O&#x2019;Hara-country-club-goy tone that he handled so well, that I despised so much. Eight generations of the best blue chips standing behind him. &#x201c;I can use a change of scenery, man.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the entire depth of your philosophical and emotional commitment to this trip, Timothy? You&#x2019;re putting me on. God knows why you feel you have to act blas� and cool even when something like this is involved. That Main Line drawl of yours. The aristocratic implication that commitment, any sort of commitment, is somehow grubby and unseemly, that it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t harangue me now,&#x201d; Timothy said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in the mood for ethnic analysis. Rather weary, in fact.&#x201d; He said it politely, disengaging from the conversation with the tiresomely intense Jewboy in his most amiably Waspish way. I hated Timothy worst of all when he started flaunting his genes at me, telling me with his easy upper-class inflections that his ancestors had founded this great country while mine were digging for potatoes in the forests of Lithuania. He said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go back to sleep.&#x201d; To Oliver he said, &#x201c;Watch the fucking road a little better, will you? And wake me up when we get to Sixty-seventh Street.&#x201d; A subtle change in his voice now that he was no longer talking to me&#x2014;to that complex and irritating member of an alien, repugnant, but perhaps superior species. Now he was the country squire addressing the simple farm boy, a relationship free of intricacies. Not that Oliver was all that simple, of course. But that was Timothy&#x2019;s existential image of him, and the image functioned to define their relationship regardless of the realities. Timothy yawned and flaked out again. Oliver stomped the gas hard and sent us shooting forward to catch up with the truck that had caused the trouble. He passed it, changed lanes, and took up a position just in front of it, daring the truckie to play games a second time. Uneasily I glanced back; the truck, a red and green monster, was nibbling at our rear bumper. High above us loomed the face of the driver, glowering, sullen, rigid: jowly stubbled cheeks, cold slitted eyes, clamped lips. He&#x2019;d run us off the road if he could. Vibrations of hatred rolling out of him. Hating us for being young, for being good-looking (me! good-looking!), for having the leisure and gelt to go to college and have useless things stuffed into our skulls. The know-nothing perched up there, the flag-waver. Flat head under his greasy cloth cap. More patriotic, more moral, than us, a hardworking American. Feeling sorry for himself because he was stuck behind four kids on a lark. I wanted to ask Oliver to move over before he rammed us. But Oliver hung in the lane, keeping the needle at fifty, penning the truck. Oliver could be very stubborn.<br><br> We were entering New York City now, via some highway that cut across the Bronx. Unfamiliar territory for me. I am a Manhattan boy; I know only the subways. Can&#x2019;t even drive a car. Highways, autos, gas stations, tollbooths&#x2014;artifacts out of a civilization with which I&#x2019;ve had only the most peripheral contact. In high school, watching the kids from the suburbs pouring into the city on weekend dates, all of them driving, with golden-haired shikses next to them on the seat: not my world, not my world at all. Yet they were only sixteen, seventeen years old, the same as I. They seemed like demigods to me. They cruised the Strip from nine o&#x2019;clock to half past one, then drove back to Larchmont, to Lawrence, to Upper Montclair, parking on some tranquil leafy street, scrambling with their dates into the back seat, white thighs flashing in the moonlight, the panties coming down, the zipper opening, the quick thrust, the grunts and groans. Whereas I was riding the subways, West Side I.R.T. That makes a difference in your sexual development. You can&#x2019;t ball a girl in the subway. What about doing it standing up in an elevator, rising to the fifteenth floor on Riverside Drive? What about making it on the tarry roof of an apartment house, 250 feet above West End Avenue, bulling your way to climax while pigeons strut around you, criticizing your technique and clucking about the pimple on your ass? It&#x2019;s another kind of life, growing up in Manhattan. Full of shortcomings and inconve-niences that wreck your adolescence. Whereas the lanky lads with the cars can frolic in four-wheeled motels. Of course, we who put up with the urban drawbacks develop compensating complexities. We have richer, more interesting souls, force-fed by adversity. I always separate the drivers from the nondrivers in drawing up my categories of people. The Olivers and the Timothys on the one hand, the Elis on the other. By rights Ned belongs with me, among the nondrivers, the thinkers, the bookish introverted tormented deprived subway riders. But he has a driver&#x2019;s license. Yet one more example of his perverted nature.<br><br> Anyway, I was glad to be back in New York, even just passing through as we were, en route to the Golden West. This was my turf. Would be, once we got past the unfamiliar Bronx into Manhattan. The paperback bookstores, the frankfurter-and-papaya-juice stands, the museums, the art movies (we don&#x2019;t call them art movies in New York, but they do), the crowds. The texture, the density. Welcome to Kosher Country. A warming sight after months in captivity in the pastoral wilds of New England, stately trees, broad avenues, white Congregationalist churches, blue-eyed people. How good it was to escape from the Ivy League simplicities of our campus and breathe foul air again. A night in Manhattan; then westward. Toward the desert. Into the clutches of the Keepers of the Skulls. I thought of that embellished page in the old manuscript, the archaic lettering, the ornamental border with the eight grinning skulls (seven missing their lower jaws, yet they manage to grin), each in its little columned cubicle. Life eternal we offer thee. How unreal the whole immortality thing seemed to me now, with the jeweled cables of the George Washington Bridge gleaming far to the southwest, and the soaring bourgeois towers of Riverdale hemming us on the right, and the garlicky realities of Manhattan straight ahead. A moment of sudden doubt. This crazy hegira. We&#x2019;re fools to take it seriously, fools to invest so much as a dime of psychological capital in a freaky fantasy. Let&#x2019;s skip Arizona and drive to Florida instead, Fort Lau-derdale, Daytona Beach. Think of all the willing suntanned nookie waiting there for the sophisticated northern lads to harvest. And, as had happened on other occasions, Ned seemed to be reading my thoughts. He threw me a sharp quizzical look and said softly, &#x201c;Never to die. Far out! But can there be anything at all to it, really?&#x201d;<br><br> 2. Ned<br><br> The fascinating part, the challenging part, what is for me the esthetically rewarding part, is that two of us must perish if the other two are to be exempted from mortality. Such are the terms offered by the Keepers of the Skulls, always assuming, first, that Eli&#x2019;s translation of the manuscript is accurate, and, second, that there&#x2019;s any substance to what he&#x2019;s told us. I think the translation must be correct&#x2014;he&#x2019;s terribly precise in philological matters&#x2014;but one must always allow for the possibility of a hoax, perhaps engineered by Eli himself. Or that it is all nonsense. Is Eli playing some baroque game with us? He&#x2019;s capable of anything, of course, a wily Hebrew, full of tricky ghetto lore, concocting an elaborate fiction so that he might inveigle three hapless goyim to their dooms, a ritual bloodbath in the desert. Do the skinny one first, the gay one, thrust the blazing sword up his ungodly asshole! More probably I&#x2019;m giving Eli credit for more deviousness than he has, projecting into him some of my own feverish warped androgynous instability. He seems sincere, a nice Jewish boy. In any group of four candidates who present themselves for the Trial, one must submit voluntarily to death, and one must become the victim of the surviving two. Sic dixit liber calvariarum. The Book of Skulls so tells us. See, me spikka da Caesarish too! Two die, two live; a lovely balance, a four-cornered mandala. I tremble in the terrible tension between extinction and infinity. For Eli the philosopher this adventure is a dark version of Pascal&#x2019;s gamble, an existentialist all-or-nothing trip. For Ned the would-be artist it is an esthetic matter, a problem of form and fulfillment. Which of us shall meet what fate? Oliver with his ferocious midwestern hunger for life: he&#x2019;ll snatch at the flask of eternity, he&#x2019;ll have to, never for an instant admitting the possibility that he might be among the ones who must exit so that the others may live. And Timothy, naturally, will come out of Arizona intact and undying, cheerfully waving his platinum spoon. His kind is bred to prevail. How can he let himself die when he has his trust fund to look forward to? Imagine, interest compounding at 6 percent per annum for, say, 18 million years. He&#x2019;ll own the universe! Far out! So those two are our obvious candidates for immortality. Eli and I therefore must yield, willingly or otherwise. Quickly the remaining roles designate their players. Eli will be the one they kill, of course; the Jew is always the victim, isn&#x2019;t he? They&#x2019;ll honey him along, grateful to him for having found the gateway to life everlasting lying in the musty archives, and at the proper ritual moment, wham, they seize him and give it to him, a quick whiff of Cyklon-B. The final solution to the Eli problem. That leaves me to be the one who volunteers for self-immolation. The decision, says Eli, citing appropriate chapter and verse from the Book of Skulls, must be genuinely voluntary, arising out of a pure wish for self-sacrifice, or it will not release the proper vibrations. Very well, gentlemen, I&#x2019;m at your service. Say the word and I&#x2019;ll do my far, far better thing. A pure wish, perhaps the first one I&#x2019;ve ever had. Two conditions, however, two strings are attached. Timothy, you must dip into your Wall Street millions and subsidize a decent edition of my poems, nicely bound, good paper, with a critical foreword by someone who knows his stuff, Trilling, Auden, Lowell, someone of that caliber. If I die for you, Timothy, if I shed my blood that you may live forever, will you do that? And Oliver: I require a service from you as well, sir. The quid pro quo is a sine qua non, as Eli would say. On the last day of life I would have an hour in private with you, my dear and handsome friend. I wish to plough your virgin soil. Be mine at last, beloved Ol! I promise to be generous with the Vaseline. Your smooth glowing almost hairless body, your taut athletic buttocks, your sweet unviolated rosebud. For me, Oliver. For me, for me, for me, all for me. I&#x2019;ll give my life for you if you&#x2019;ll lend me your bum a single afternoon. Am I not romantic? Is your dilemma not a delicious one? Come across, Oliver, or else no deal. You will, too. You aren&#x2019;t any puritan, and you&#x2019;re a practical man, a me-firster. You&#x2019;ll see the advantages of surrender. You&#x2019;d better. Humor the little faggot, Oliver. Or else no deal.<br><br> 3. Timothy<br><br> Eli takes all this much more seriously than the rest of us. I suppose that&#x2019;s fair; he was the one who found out about it and organized the whole operation. And anyway he&#x2019;s got the half-mystic quality, that smouldering Eastern European wildness, that permits a man to get worked up really big over something that in the last analysis you know is imaginary. I suppose it&#x2019;s a Jewish trait, tied in with the kabbala and whatnot. At least I think of it as a Jewish trait, along with high intelligence, physical cowardice, and a love of making money, but what the crap do I know about Jews, anyway? Look at us in this car. Oliver&#x2019;s got the highest intelligence, no doubt about that. Ned&#x2019;s the physical coward; you just look at him and he cringes. I&#x2019;m the one with the money, although Christ knows I had nothing to do with the making of it. There are your so-called Jewish traits. And the mysticism? Is Eli a mystic? Maybe he just doesn&#x2019;t want to die. Is there anything so mystic about that?<br><br> No, not about that. But when it comes to believing that there&#x2019;s this cult of exiled Babylonian or Egyptian or whatever immortals living in the desert, believing that if you go to them and say the right words they&#x2019;ll confer the privilege of immortality on you&#x2014;oh, lordy! Who could buy that? Eli can. Oliver too, maybe. Ned? No, not Ned. Ned doesn&#x2019;t believe in anything, not even himself. And not me. You bet your ass, not me.<br><br> Why am I going, then?</p><h2>Understanding the Faith of the Church (Churchs Teaching, Vol 4)</h2><p>Book by Norris, Richard Alfred</p><p></p><h2>Leathercraft: Inspirational Projects for You and Your Home</h2><p><p>Learn how to make lovely leather projects with a professional finish. <strong><em>Leathercraft</em></strong> features fabulous, handcrafted leather items for your wardrobe and your home.

In <b>A Modern History of the Islamic World,</b> eminent scholar Reinhard Schulze charts the history of these societies in the twentieth century, revealing what they have in common as well as their equally profound differences.</p> <p>Rather than stringing together individual studies of different countries, the book is structured chronologically, tracing political change in the context of culture and society. Schulze opens with a survey of the impact of colonialism and its attendant modernizing effects on the Islamic world. He then moves on to examine the rise of bourgeois nationalism in the 1920s and 1930s, the era of independence movements, the relationship between Islamic cultures and the "republican" political culture of the Third World, the reassertion of Islamic ideologies in the 1970s and 1980s and, finally, the issues surrounding the relationship between Islamic culture and civil society that dominated debate in the 1990s.</p> <p><b>A Modern History of the Islamic World</b> provides a clear overview of the ways in which twentieth century modernism affected the societies of the Islamic world and how modernism was developed from an Islamic perspective.</p></p><p><p><b>REINHARD SCHULZE</b> is Professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Berne.</p><p>"Schulze's contribution is important to ongoing global political events.

Much of it is told in their own voices as they gossip about prominent people of their time, advise family members on political and financial strategy, soothe each other&#x2019;s sorrows, and rejoice in each other&#x2019;s triumphs. <br> <br>Descended from one of the nation&#x2019;s founding fathers and raised to be educated, independent, and opinionated young women, Marianne, Bess, Louisa, and Emily Caton traveled to England in 1816 and won coveted places at the highest levels of Regency society by virtue of their charm, intelligence, and great beauty. An unusual, remarkable true story of money, love, and life at the top, <i>Sisters of Fortune</i> is a romantic family history and an inside look at the adventures of America&#x2019;s original blue-blooded girls.</p><p><b>Jehanne Wake</b> graduated from Oxford University and is the author of&nbsp;the biography <i>Princess Louise, Queen Victoria's Unconventional Daughter.</i>&nbsp; She lives in London.&nbsp; Visit her website at www.jehannewake.com.Marianne, Louisa, Bess, and Emily Caton were heiresses of the early 19th century with impeccable American breeding. Three of them sailed to England, married aristocrats, and left a legacy of public success, financial savvy, and an independence worthy of their family's heritage: their grandfather, a wealthy planter, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Wake (Princess Louise: Queen Victoria's Unconventional Daughter) details the sisters' formative years with their grandfather Charles Carroll, their early favorable impression in England, and their high-status marriages. Although the sisters were sometimes labeled fortune seekers, Wade proves that their intelligence and diplomacy often improved the positions of their husbands, including Emily, who married a Canadian and eventually returned to Maryland. In between descriptions of parties in Regency England and post-Restoration France and intimate pre-Victorian royal relationships, the Catons' deep interest in financial ventures, improving acceptance of Catholicism, their founding of orphanages, and their intense familial relationships support Wake's assertion that these remarkable women successfully negotiated unpopular issues that might have ruined lesser women. In Wake's hands, the sisters still dazzle, blending continental influences with their enviable but heartbreaking adventures in England and France. 16 pages of color and 16 pages of b&amp;w photos; 2 maps.

He flew for the first time at the age of twelve, at the Amb�rieu airfield, and it was then that he became determined to be a pilot. He kept that ambition even after moving to a school in Switzerland and while spending summer vacations at the family's ch�teau at Saint-Maurice-de-R�mens, in eastern France. (The house at Saint-Maurice appears again and again in Saint-Exup�ry's writing.)<br><br>Later, in Paris, he failed the entrance exams for the French naval academy and, instead, enrolled at the prestigious art school l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In 1921 Saint-Exup�ry began serving in the military, and was stationed in Strasbourg. There he learned to be a pilot, and his career path was forever settled. <br><br>After leaving the service, in 1923, Saint-Exup�ry worked in several professions, but in 1926 he went back to flying and signed on as a pilot for A�ropostale, a private airline that flew mail from Toulouse, France, to Dakar, Senegal. In 1927 Saint-Exup�ry accepted the position of airfield chief for Cape Juby, in southern Morocco, and began writing his first book, a memoir called Southern Mail, which was published in 1929. He then moved briefly to Buenos Aires to oversee the establishment of an Argentinean mail service; when he returned to Paris in 1931, he published Night Flight, which won instant success and the prestigious Prix Femina. <br><br>Always daring, Saint-Exup�ry tried in 1935 to break the speed record for flying from Paris to Saigon. Unfortunately, his plane crashed in the Libyan desert, and he and his copilot had to trudge through the sand for three days to find help. In 1938 he was seriously injured in a second plane crash, this time as he tried to fly between New York City and Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. The crash resulted in a long convalescence in New York. <br><br>Saint-Exup�ry's next novel, Wind, Sand and Stars, was published in 1939. A great success, the book won the Acad�mie Fran�aise's Grand Prix du Roman (Grand Prize for Novel Writing) and the National Book Award in the United States. At the beginning of the Second World War, Saint-Exup�ry flew reconnaissance missions for France, but he went to New York to ask the United States for help when the Germans occupied his country. He drew on his wartime experiences to write Flight to Arras and Letter to a Hostage, both published in 1942. His classic The Little Prince appeared in 1943. Later in 1943 Saint-Exup�ry rejoined his French air squadron in northern Africa. Despite being forbidden to fly (he was still suffering physically from his earlier plane crashes), Saint-Exup�ry insisted on being given a mission. On July 31, 1944, he set out from Borgo, Corsica, to overfly occupied France. He never returned.</p><h2>Darling&#39;s Model Kit #1B (Molecular Visions Organic Model Kit, with Pop-Up box)</h2><p>Flexible molecular model kit: &#34;Featuring an easy push/pull coupling system&#34;</p><p></p><h2>As Told at the Explorers Club: More Than Fifty Gripping Tales of Adventure</h2><p>For more than a century, The Explorers Club has been the meeting place for some of the most daring adventurers on the planet.

The focus is the complete process of creating unique dolls from the new polymer and paper clays, especially dolls which combine sculpted clay with cloth bodies. The author emphasizes creativity rather than imitation, teaching the arts and skills of bringing your idea to life through the sculpture. After discussing how to think about your idea and about specific planning, she introduces supplies and the ways you should begin to think. She then takes you through each detailed step in sculpting the head and body, curing and finishing the materials, constructing the body and clothing, and creating a display. Clear drawings illustrate every detailed step in the process. For additional inspiration, there are color photographs of dolls by some sixty professional artists. In addition to the instructional materials and the gallery of dolls, the author includes reference materials about the new clays, drawing upon experiences other artists have had in working with them. There are lists of resources, study exercises, and much more.</p><p>In <i>Anatomy of a Doll</i> master dollmaker Susanna Oroyan gave us a definitive work on cloth dollmaking. In <i>Fantastic Figures</i> she concentrates on unique dolls made from polymer and paper clays, especially those that combine sculpted clay with cloth bodies. Emphasizing innovation rather than imitation, she provides lengthy and detailed information on the clays themselves; on sculpting the head, hands, feet, and legs; on finishing medium and painting methods; and on constructing the body, clothes, hair, accessories, and even display stands and tableau settings. The appendix discusses doll clubs and organizations and offers advice from other doll experts. Numerous line drawings and diagrams supplement the text, but the best feature is the set of exquisite color photographs of dolls made by 60 professional doll artists, some of whose creations are almost frightening in their startling realism.</p><h2>Travels With Cole Porter</h2><p>This commemorative of the hundredth anniversary of Cole Porter&#39;s birth is filled with more than three hundred rare photographs of his glamorous life and his two elaborate journeys to Europe and the Middle East</p><p>Fans of the legendary composer (1891-1964) will pore over the 300 black-and-white photographs and brief accompanying reminiscences by former showgirl and author Howard ( Jean Howard's Hollywood ). Howard joined Porter and other friends on two luxurious trips in the mid-'50s. No matter where Porter went--the south of France, the Greek islands, Switzerland or Egypt--he traveled in grand style. Often sailing on the yacht Eros , owned by Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, when on land Porter frequently rented private railroad cars for long trips. For such shorter jaunts as the commute from his suite at the Waldorf Towers to his Massachusetts country home, or spins around Palermo and Monte Carlo, he used his chauffeured Cadillac limousine. An accomplished photographer, Howard further enlivens her account with excerpts from Porter's diaries. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shakespeare&#39;s Storybook</h2><p>Discover some of the secrets to Shakespeare&#39;s inspiration.

You will never find contentment in living for what you hope tomorrow may hold. Contentment is for today. <p>"Why is it that only women on the brink of marriage get showered with household appliances, fine china, and beautiful crystal? Why is it that only brides-to-be obtain the desired goods for domesticity and dinner parties? Do married women cook and entertain more frequently than single women? In some cases, yes, but why should single women who do cook and entertain go without the items necessary for doing it well? They shouldn&#x2019;t! In fact, such thinking applies to much more than dishware. That is because life doesn&#x2019;t begin when you get married." &#x2014;from the Introduction </p><p>Here Lydia Brownback (a single, content woman herself) shows us that the single life is not a life of lacking, but a life of living.

He wasn&#x2019;t killed by the cave-in, however, but by a knife wound in his back. When Pliny gives the body a forensic examination, he finds two more puzzling things: a circumcision (unusual in Rome), and thirty pieces of silver in his sewn-closed mouth.

It tells of events in Naples, where Vinci and Pergolesi went beyond their pre-1720 models to cultivate opera in a simpler, more direct manner, soon after christened the galant style. No less central was Venice, where Vivaldi perfected the concerto, on which were patterned the early symphonies and the newer kind of sonata. Dresden profited first from all these achievements and became, under Hasse's direction, the foremost center of Italian opera in Germany. Mannheim with its great orchestra did much to shape the modern symphony. A few years later, Paris became paramount, especially for its Op�ra-Comique; during the 1770s the Op�ra provided Gluck with a stage on which to cap his long international career. The book concludes with a description of Christian Bach in London, Paisiello in Saint Petersburg, and Boccherini in Madrid.<br><br> This long-awaited book offers a view of eighteenth-century music that is broad and innovative while remaining sensitive to the values of those times and places. One comes away from it with an understanding of the European context behind the triumphs of Haydn and Mozart.<br><br> Lavishly illustrated with music examples and reproductions, both in black-and-white and color, this master study will be of inestimable importance to scholars, cultural historians, performers, and all music lovers.</p><p>Daniel Heartz, Ph.D., professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, is the recipient of Guggenheim Fellowships, two ASCAP&#x2013;Deems Taylor Awards, and the Kinkeldey Award of the American Musicological Society.

A Native American people, now known as the Hopewell, lived and worked these lands, building earthworks which in some instances dwarf the ruins at Stonehenge. More significantly, these mammoth earthworks were built in different geometric shapes, using a standard unit of measure and aligned to the cycles of the sun and the moon. Using the foundation of existing scholarship, Mysteries of the Hopewell presents new discoveries showing the accomplishments of the Mound Builders in astronomy, geometry, measurement, and counting. William Romain then goes one step further to theorize why generations of people toiled to move millions of tons of earth to form these precise structures, joining the ranks of the Egyptians, Mayans, Greeks, Chinese, and other advanced ancient cultures. William Romain&#39;s Mysteries of the Hopewell will appeal to many readers, including anthropologists, mathematicians, and historians, but perhaps especially to readers curious about ancient cultures and seeking explanations for these magnificent earthen structures.</p><p>William F.

Emphasizing class struggles that have proliferated across the social body of global capitalism, Caffentzis shows how these struggles are so central to the dynamic of the system that even the most sophisticated machines cannot liberate capitalism from class struggle and the need for labor. The writings draw upon a careful rereading of Marx&#x2019;s thought in order to elucidate political concerns of the day and document the peculiar way in which capital perpetuates violence and proliferates misery on a world scale.</p></p><p><p><strong>George Caffentzis is a professor of philosophy at the University of Southern Maine and a founding member of the Midnight Notes Collective.

This book was written originally for a Polish audience and published there before Spielberg's film was released in Poland. It now appears here in a somewhat awkward translation (``But I am asking him to stop avoiding the issue of my statement''). As a TV and print journalist, Palowski has covered the top echelon of the Polish film industry for many years; he was one of the many people who pushed to bring the filming of Schindler's List to the country in which many of the events took place, and he spent some time with Spielberg before filming began. He may be a battle-hardened reporter, but when he finds himself surrounded by the likes of Spielberg, Ben Kingsley, George Lucas, and other Hollywood heavyweights, he is reduced to Jell-O. Palowski is close friends with the man whose story triggered Thomas Keneally's interest in Schindler's Jews, an LA businessman named Poldek Page, and when he is recounting the stories of Page and other Holocaust survivors, this book is surefooted and fresh. But mostly this slender volume recounts the day-to-day trivia of Spielberg's filming in Krakow and its vicinity, as seen from something of a distance. The book's tone is surprisingly naive, given the author's familiarity with the entertainment industry, and that's what gives it a certain dopey charm, but there's little here that will enlighten those interested in filmmaking, the Holocaust, or Spielberg. (photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>When Steven Spielberg went to Krakow, Poland, to create a film based on <i>Schindler's List</i>, the best-selling book about the rescue of 1,200 Jews by German businessman Oskar Schindler during the Holocaust, he tried to include all the fascinating stories about that remarkable event. But even a feature film could not contain them all, and Palowski, a renowned Polish journalist, attempts to include the remainder here. He interviews survivors and describes the ordeal of filming on location under adverse conditions. Reenacting this sad and unusual chapter of history created many meaningful events. A woman who was tormented by concentration camp commander Amon Goeth almost fainted after seeing actor Ralph Fiennes in costume. Other survivors tell Palowski their memories from the war as the production moves take by take through the streets and houses of the old Jewish ghetto. It is a fascinating account but suffers from a poor, often awkward translation. Those who enjoyed the film will find this book very interesting. <i>Ted Leventhal</i></p><h2>Feelings</h2><p>What you feel is who you are...Explore a world of emotions with this stunning peep-through picture book.

But can they combat the whole spectrum of social injustice---including conditions that aren't directly caused by bigotry? In <i>Rights Gone Wrong</i>, Richard Thompson Ford argues that extremists on both sides of the political divide have hijacked civil rights for personal advantage, diverting our attention from serious social injustices. Is equality really served by endless litigating and legislating against every grievance or slight?

A fraud, a racket. For a long while we were hearing that every minority child had asthma&nbsp;... Why was there an asthma epidemic amongst minority children? Because I&#x2019;ll tell you why: the children got extra welfare if they were disabled, and they got extra help in school. It was a money racket&nbsp;... Now the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I&#x2019;ll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it&#x2019;s a brat who hasn&#x2019;t been told to cut the act out. That&#x2019;s what autism is&nbsp;... Everybody has an illness&nbsp;... Stop with the sensitivity training. You&#x2019;re turning your son into a girl and you&#x2019;re turning your nation into a nation of losers.<br>On July 16, 2008, the radio talk show host Michael Savage managed to offend parents of disabled children, racial minorities, and women in less than a minute and a half&#x2014;an accomplishment that his rivals Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck can only aspire to. The group Autism United demonstrated in front of the New York radio station that carries Savage&#x2019;s program. One of his sponsors, the insurance company Aflac, promptly gave Savage some unwelcome sensitivity training: it pulled its advertising from his program, explaining that the company found &#x201c;his recent comments about autistic children to be both inappropriate and insensitive.&#x201d; Criticism was almost unanimous among doctors, child psychologists, disability rights advocates, parents, and pundits alike. Several local stations dropped Savage&#x2019;s program in response to public outrage.<br>Savage is a provocateur&#x2014;deliberately insulting and extreme, with a loose regard for factual accuracy. According to the clinical psychologist Catherine Lord, autism is &#x201c;just like epilepsy or&nbsp;... diabetes or a heart condition. [Savage&#x2019;s comments are] like blaming the child with a heart condition for not being able to exercise.&#x201d;1 Savage eventually backpedaled, saying his remarks were &#x201c;hyperbole,&#x201d; designed to draw attention to the problem of fraudulent diagnosis. He agreed to devote another show to the subject so that parents of autistic children and others could air dissenting views.<br>Savage, like Limbaugh and Beck, is conservative and contentious, but he is also idiosyncratic&#x2014;often unexpectedly thoughtful, even cerebral. While Limbaugh and Beck are activists for conservative politicians and causes, Savage is distinguished by a kind of crotchety ennui. As contemptuous of other conservatives as he is of liberals (he called Glenn Beck a &#x201c;hemorrhoid with eyes&#x201d;), he treats partisan politics with an aloof disdain: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to go to one of the other talk-show hosts to get &#x2018;Obama&#x2019;s a Ma-a-arxist&#x2019; and &#x2018;McCain is a wa-a-ar hero.&#x2019;&#x201d;2 As a result, where other conservative talk show hosts are annoyingly predictable, Savage&#x2019;s off-the-cuff ramblings and intemperate tirades are often surprising and intriguing, and they often contain at least a grain of truth. For instance, Dr. Lord admitted that mild autism is vaguely defined and can be a catchall diagnosis for children with behavioral problems who fit no other category. A year and a half after Savage&#x2019;s remarks, the psychiatrists in charge of writing the fifth edition of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> announced that they were considering folding several types of mild autism&#x2014;such as Asperger&#x2019;s syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder&#x2014;into a single broad category&#x2014;autism spectrum disorder&#x2014;reflecting a new understanding that autism is not a single disorder but rather a range of conditions, from severe mental disabilities to mild emotional abnormalities that can come with extraordinary mental gifts.<br>There&#x2019;s a professional consensus that severe autism is a discrete neurobiological condition, but mild cases can be hard to distinguish from less well-defined conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other vaguely defined &#x201c;learning disabilities.&#x201d; Here, diagnosis is difficult and contestable, and expert opinions differ. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re fairly good about making the diagnosis of kids who are classically autistic, but as you move away from that specific disorder, it gets harder&nbsp;... [F]or kids who are of average, close to average or above average intelligence, it is difficult to sort out what is eccentricity versus what is a real social deficit,&#x201d; said Dr. Lord.3<br>Federal law doesn&#x2019;t reflect a continuum that includes mild autism and learning disabilities along with eccentricity and poor concentration. For legal purposes, a disability is a discrete condition: either you have it, and therefore have a right to an array of special concessions and extra help, or you don&#x2019;t. The law doesn&#x2019;t define learning disabilities with precision, but it does provide a partial definition: &#x201c;a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability.&#x201d;4 In practice, this means that learning disabilities are diagnosed, in large part, by identifying a gap between a child&#x2019;s performance in academic settings and the performance one would expect of a child of his or her age and IQ.<br>Civil rights laws entitle <i>all</i> disabled people to special accommodations and services: a blind person might require an exam to be administered orally or written in Braille; a paraplegic might require voice-recognition software or transcription. These accommodations let the disabled reach their potential. Children with learning disabilities are also legally entitled to accommodations and services that other children are not, such as special tutoring and extra time on exams. In theory, just as a blind person needs Braille, a Seeing Eye dog, or a cane to overcome his blindness, a person with ADHD may need extra time to get organized and overcome his inability to concentrate.<br>But there are some important differences between severe disabilities like blindness and milder learning and behavioral disabilities. First, conspicuous disabilities often trigger reflexive animus or prejudice. Many employers wrongly assume disabled people can&#x2019;t work, and businesses discriminate against them because of squeamishness and irrational aversion. A business that refuses to accommodate a disabled person might secretly wish to exclude him. Milder disabilities don&#x2019;t trigger such reflexive prejudice because, for the most part, they are not conspicuous: typically an employer learns of a learning or an emotional disability only when an employee seeks an accommodation for it. Second, most of the accommodations that people with severe disabilities need wouldn&#x2019;t help a nondisabled person at all. A sighted person wouldn&#x2019;t benefit from having an exam written in Braille; an able-bodied person wouldn&#x2019;t get much of an edge from using voice-recognition software or a professional transcriber. By contrast, people with learning and emotional disabilities often enjoy extra time on competitive exams, costly one-on-one tutoring, and exemptions from discipline for disruptive behavior&#x2014;things that would benefit anyone. Finally, unlike blindness or a physical disability, many learning disabilities are hard to define objectively; as Dr. Lord admits, they are on a continuum with ordinary &#x201c;eccentricity.&#x201d; Put these together and you have a recipe for gaming the system: no one would suggest that an eccentric person with a wandering mind has a right to extra time on a timed exam, but someone with ADHD does&#x2014;and the two can be hard to distinguish. This doesn&#x2019;t suggest that civil rights for people with mild cognitive disabilities are a &#x201c;racket,&#x201d; but it does suggest that they have the potential to encourage opportunism and can lead to unwarranted advantages.<br>Suppose two children achieve low scores on a competitive timed exam: one has a diagnosed learning disability, and the other doesn&#x2019;t. Suppose both of the children&#x2019;s scores would improve dramatically if they had extra time to complete the exam. Is it fair to give one student extra time and not the other? Maybe. In theory, the extra time isn&#x2019;t an advantage for the person with a learning disability; it&#x2019;s just the way he copes with his disability. But if the disability is on a continuum with garden-variety poor concentration, then in fairness <i>anyone</i> with poor concentration should be entitled to extra time in proportion to the severity of his concentration deficit. This would, of course, defeat the purpose of a timed exam, which is to test not only skills and knowledge but also the ability to perform quickly.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The Harvard medical student Sophie Currier became a heroine to advocates of breast-feeding in 2007 when she demanded and eventually won the right to a breast-pumping break during a medical licensing exam. No hothouse flower, Currier first took the exam&#x2014;widely considered to be one of the most challenging of all professional qualification exams&#x2014;when eight months pregnant and came just short of a passing score. Currier chose to nurse her newborn baby as most experts in the medical profession she was poised to join recommend.

The author does not sugar-coat the process of true spiritual transformation. You will be called upon to come to terms with yourself as you discover the things that always get in the way of your true spiritual progress. Armed with this special knowledge, you can gain the inside track and have a fighting chance toward reaching your God-given human potential. These essays offer many stinging revelations that will challenge your strongest beliefs to the very bone and take you completely out of your comfort zone. Such anti-intuitive revelations will convince you that: - Being famous or enjoying elite status won&#39;t help you! - Going to church won&#39;t help you! - Eating healthy foods and exercising won&#39;t help you! - Living an outwardly civil or moral life won&#39;t even help you! This book is not about becoming a citizen of the world; it&#39;s about becoming a citizen of heaven, which is why God created each of us. We have failed to grasp this divine goal as a personal obligation and responsibility in our own lives. Modern life has provided humankind with knowledge about practically everything. But we really don&#39;t know ourselves. Because of this, the world is full of perplexing problems and atrocities. Even seemingly rational and good-natured individuals have no clue as to the real obstacles that stand in the way of harmonious living. Based on the spiritual influences of Emanuel Swedenborg and George Gurdjieff, the ideas in this book will help you identify what these obstacles are. These new insights will have an unsettling effect on your self-image, but allow you to rise above your current biological self. An essential read for anyone who takes their spiritual transformation seriously.</p><p>Philosopher/Theologian Edward F. Sylvia attended the School of Visual Arts in New York.

You'll find important answers about treating asthma, head injuries, fevers, stomach bugs, colic, earaches, and other ailments. More than just a book on how to care for your child's physical well-being, <em>The New Basics</em> also covers such parenting challenges as biting, hitting, ADD, separation anxiety, how to prevent the terrible twos (and threes and fours ...), and preparing your child for a new sibling.</p></p><p>Pediatrician Michel Cohen delights in offering anxious parents unconventional wisdom about children and toddlers: "less medicine is often the best medicine." Following an A to Z format, Cohen successfully skewers myths about every aspect of childcare. Using generic case kids "Lucy" and "Jimmy," and "real questions from real parents" he offers a compendium of health care information. Whether talking about behavior (bed-wetting, thumb sucking, school anxiety), symptoms (green mucus, earwax or eczema), or prevention (immunization, vitamins, toothbrushing), Cohen's approach is fresh and his tone is wise and wry--when discussing the drawbacks of medication for carsickness, he suggests that the best remedy is a plastic bag. Consistent core beliefs underline Cohen's alphabet: Doctors should not medicate all ills, antibiotics weaken natural immunity, you can't spoil your baby, but you can spoil your life. This practical, enjoyable guide is limited only by its short A-Z format--the information is so clear and valuable that parents will surely want to hear more from Dr. Cohen. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i><p>Michel Cohen, M.D., is the founder of Tribeca Pediatrics.

This pioneering and eclectic California photographer, active from the century's beginning to the '70s, "isolat[ed] her subject;... minimized the background, expanded scale with close-up scrutiny, and formalized presentation" for her floral studies, writes curator-critic Lorenz in a broad-based and sometimes flowery text accompanying 161 photos. Though attuned to pure nature for most of her career, Cunningham was also a "sophisticated aesthete" who "often delighted in upsetting common values"--a startling example being her double-image portrait of the artist Morris Graves, who is "psychically incorporated" into a forested landscape. Through extensive resort to contrasts and affinities vis-a-vis Cunningham's contemporaries--Weston, Adams, Stieglitz et al.--the author encompasses a seminal era in artistic photography, with Cunningham, about whom he has written three other books, as the star. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Once More With Feeling</h2><p>Six women share their stories about arriving in L.A. with dreams of fame and fortune, but instead encountering the darker, seedier side of Hollywood</p><p></p><h2>Surviving the Holocaust: The Kovno Ghetto Diary</h2><p><p>This remarkable chronicle of life and death in the Jewish Ghetto of Kovno, Lithuania, from June 1941 to January 1944, was written under conditions of extreme danger by a Ghetto inmate and secretary of the Jewish Council.

It takes a person with the longevity and experience to have known Europe since the war, a sensitivity and intelligence to reflect with insight, and the eloquence to bring it alive. It was Jan Morris&#39;s book to write, and the world is richer for her having done so. Historian, travel writer, and novelist--Morris takes an intimate trip through Europe, from Trieste at the end of World War II to booking passage on the Chunnel train and contemplating a modern, united Europe. With her keen use of language, astute eye, and personal touch, Morris narrates engagingly the pride, pathos, and ironies of Europe.The fall of the Berlin Wall and the dramatic changes in Europe have produced a virtual industry of publications. Now comes the book we've been waiting for: master travel writer Morris's (Sydney, 1992; O Canada, 1992, etc.) uncannily astute reflections on how Europe has developed over the past 50 years. It is 51 years exactly since Morris, then named James, a young Anglo-Welsh soldier in Trieste, first took notes on his European experience. Although Morris's 1972 gender change is not discussed directly in these writings, they offer a deeply personal and subjective view of a continent observed by a perceptive eyewitness who, it so happens, has had the added advantage of experiencing it as both man and woman. Morris's is a truly unique voice. The book consists of vignettes loosely structured under five chapter headings. It begins with ``Holy Symptoms,'' characteristically serious but witty responses to the role of paganism and Christianity as ``universal defining factors'' in European history. Morris, an ardent Welsh patriot, brings a singular understanding to the subject of Europe's ethnic and geographic diversity and the bloody business of nation-building in the next two sections. The final chapters cover Europe's increasing homogenization and the six attempts to unify the continent, from the Holy Roman Empire to the European Union. Morris's understanding of both the follies and the dignity of patriotism lie behind her ability to laugh at and delight in others' idiosyncrasies. With the Germans, Morris admits to having a love-hate relationship, and her pieces on Germany's rich cultural legacy set against its Nazi past are among the most moving in the book. The glory of France she finds ``insidiously seductive'' because it strikes her as ``perfectly humorless,'' whereas it is the ``sycophancy of older Austrians'' that she most dislikes. For every nation, for every region or town, from Finland to Greece, Morris delivers a precise, moving, and eloquent reflection. Fifty Years of Europe is a delight. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

These images were collected and engraved in 1590 by the Flemish publisher and printmaker Theodor de Bry and were reproduced widely, establishing the visual prototype of North American Indians for European and Euro-American readers. </p><p>In this innovative analysis, Michael Gaudio explains how popular engravings of Native American Indians defined the nature of Western civilization by producing an image of its &#x201c;savage other.&#x201d; Going beyond the notion of the &#x201c;savage&#x201d; as an intellectual and ideological construct, Gaudio examines how the tools, materials, and techniques of copperplate engraving shaped Western responses to indigenous peoples. Engraving the Savage demonstrates that the early visual critics of the engravings attempted-without complete success-to open a comfortable space between their own &#x201c;civil&#x201d; image-making practices and the &#x201c;savage&#x201d; practices of Native Americans-such as tattooing, bodily ornamentation, picture-writing, and idol worship. The real significance of these ethnographic engravings, he contends, lies in the traces they leave of a struggle to create meaning from the image of the American Indian.</p><p>The visual culture of engraving and what it shows, Gaudio reasons, is critical to grasping how America was first understood in the European imagination. His interpretations of de Bry&#x2019;s engravings describe a deeply ambivalent pictorial space in between civil and savage-a space in which these two organizing concepts of Western culture are revealed in their making.</p><p>Michael Gaudio is assistant professor of art history at the University of Minnesota.</p></p><p></p><h2>Ladybird Histories: Ancient Egyptians</h2><p><p>This Ladybird Histories book all about Ancient Egypt is perfect for children learning about Ancient Egypt and the Egyptians at school.

The challenges they put forward extend beyond philosophy and entail a reconsideration of the foundations of belief in God and the religious life. They urge that the rejection of metaphysical truth does not necessitate the death of religion; instead it opens new ways of imagining what it is to be religious&#x2015;ways that emphasize charity, solidarity, and irony. This unique collaboration, which includes a dialogue between the two philosophers, is notable not only for its fusion of pragmatism (Rorty) and hermeneutics (Vattimo) but also for its recognition of the limits of both traditional religious belief and modern secularism.<br><br>In "Anticlericalism and Atheism" Rorty discusses Vattimo's work <i>Belief</i> and argues that the end of metaphysics paves the way for an anti-essentialist religion. Rorty's conception of religion, determined by private motives, is designed to produce the gospel's promise that henceforth God will not consider humanity as a servant but as a friend. In "The Age of Interpretation," Vattimo, who is both a devout Catholic and a frequent critic of the church, explores the surprising congruence between Christianity and hermeneutics in light of the dissolution of metaphysical truth. As in hermeneutics, interpretation is central to Christianity, which introduced the world to the principle of interiority, dissolving the experience of objective reality into "listening to and interpreting messages." <br><br>The lively dialogue that concludes this volume, moderated and edited by Santiago Zabala, analyzes the future of religion together with the political, social, and historical aspects that characterize our contemporary postmodern, postmetaphysical, and post-Christian world.</p><p>Though coming from distinct intellectual traditions, Richard Rorty and Gianni Vattimo are united in their criticism of the metaphysical tradition.

In 1989, veteran journalist Serge Schmemann was in his hotel room when his assistant from East Germany burst in with some incredible news: the Berlin Wall was open. Serge jumped into the first cab he could find and raced to the wall in time to witness one of the great moments of European history.</p><p>Including articles from the archives of The New York Times, this gripping narrative tells the whole story, from the division of Germany after World War II, to life in the Communist East, to the massive protests that brought an end to the Eastern Bloc, and the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p></p><p><p>Serge Schmemann served as Bonn bureau chief for The New York Times from 1987 to 1991 and won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the reunification of Germany.

A chilly evening in West Berlin. I was in my hotel room, <br>writing furiously on my laptop. The stories were breaking fast. The <br>Communist government in East Germany was in crisis. All through the <br>autumn, East Germans had been fleeing their country in droves through <br>Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Even greater numbers had been holding regular <br>marches in East German cities, demanding reform. The government`s <br>authority was crumbling. Every day there were new changes, new <br>announcements, new surprises.</p><br><p><br>I had just returned from a press conference in East Berlin, at which the <br>Communist leaders had announced new travel regulations for East Germans <br>who wanted to visit the West. That was big news: up to then, the majority of <br>East Germans, like most Eastern Europeans, had been prevented from <br>leaving the East. It was a good story, probably page one, so when somebody <br>knocked on the door around midnight, I was annoyed. It was my assistant <br>from East Berlin, Victor Homola.</p><br><p><br>"I`m busy, Victor," I barked. "Grab something from the minibar and wait."</p><br><p><br>"But, Serge..."</p><br><p><br>"Not now! Not now..."</p><br><p><br>Then it struck me: Victor? He was an East German! He wasn`t allowed to <br>cross into the West; he`d never even been to the West.</p><br><p><br>"Victor! What on earth are you doing here?"</p><br><p><br>"That`s what I`m trying to tell you, Serge! The wall is down!"</p><br><p><br>That began one of the most exciting stories I`ve covered as a foreign <br>correspondent: the fall of the Berlin Wall. For many, the event has come to <br>represent the end of forty years in which Eastern Europe was held captive by <br>the Soviet Union. But it was not only a political story. It was also an intensely <br>human story, about people rising up to break down a wall that had kept them <br>brutally apart&#x2014;a wall that had divided Germany, and all of Europe, into a free <br>and democratic West and an East that lived under dictatorship. </p><br><p><br>It was about people choosing freedom.</p><br><p><br>I grabbed my West German assistant, Tom Seibert, and with Victor we <br>jumped into a taxi. The streets near the Berlin Wall were quickly filling with <br>celebrating Germans, and the police were trying to divert traffic. The taxi <br>driver, a big woman with a bigger voice, was yelling out the window, "Ich habe <br>hier drei Pressefritzen!"&#x2014;</p><br><p><br>"I have three press guys here!"&#x2014;and the police waved us through. <br>We drove right up to the most important stretch of the wall&#x2014;the spot where it <br>passed by the Brandenburg Gate, once the very center of Berlin. </p><br><p><br>The Berlin Wall was a frightening sight, a twelve-foot-high concrete barrier <br>that divided one of the major cities of Europe right in half. It did more than <br>that&#x2014;since West Berlin was deep inside East Germany, the wall actually ran <br>all around it, creating a large urban island of the free, democratic, and brightly <br>lit West right inside the tightly controlled Communist-ruled East. The worlds <br>inside and outside the wall were completely different&#x2014;within its wall, West <br>Berlin looked like any large Western city. Shiny Mercedes and BMW sedans <br>cruised the neon-lit Kudamm&#x2014;the grand Kurfürstendamm boulevard; store <br>windows displayed the latest in fashions; restaurants and nightclubs were <br>open late into the night. West Berlin had theaters, museums, a university, <br>skyscrapers, two airports, a lake, rivers, canals, parks, even a zoo. West <br>Berliners could easily go to West Germany, or anywhere else in Western <br>Europe, so they felt free and secure inside their walled-in island.</p><br><p><br>On the East German side of the wall, large blocks of anonymous apartment <br>buildings loomed. There were far fewer shops, and everything seemed grayer <br>and poorer. The East Germans heated their buildings with poor-quality coal, <br>so everything was covered with soot. Still, parts of East Berlin had retained <br>the old-fashioned charm of a central European city, recalling old black-and-<br>white spy movies.</p><br><p><br>In fact, life in East Berlin was better than in Moscow and many other Eastern <br>European cities. But the East Germans were always aware of the bright <br>lights in the Western island in their midst. West Germany deliberately aimed <br>radio and television signals eastward, so it was easy for most East Germans <br>to receive them. East German teenagers were more savvy about what was <br>happening in the West than teenagers in other parts of Eastern Europe&#x2014;and <br>because of that they were much more frustrated. Though it was West Berlin <br>that was encircled, many East German children grew up thinking the wall <br>was around them. The wall itself reflected the difference between the two <br>governments it divided&#x2014;from the Eastern side, it was like a prison wall, with <br>watchtowers and glaring lights; from the West, or from inside, it was covered <br>with bright and ever-changing graffiti.</p><br><p><br>Before Berlin was divided, the Brandenburg Gate had been the city`s most <br>famous landmark. Now, the gate was actually part of the Berlin Wall. The <br>main wall ran past it on the west side, while police barriers on the east <br>formed a no man`s land around it. For decades, trying to cross that no man`s <br>land had meant possible death or imprisonment for East Germans.</p><br><p><br>Now, joyful East Berliners were scaling the barriers and running to the wall. <br>On our side, West Germans were climbing up on top of the wall and reaching <br>down to haul up their Eastern cousins. An observation platform on the <br>Western side, built so visitors could look at the Brandenburg Gate, was full of <br>dancing people.</p><br><p><br>"The wall is gone! The wall is gone!" people chanted. As we watched, more <br>and more East Germans poured over, and more and more West Germans <br>gathered to greet them with tears and champagne. For thirty years, these <br>people had dreamed of the day when they could be together again. Tom, a <br>university student from Bonn who was my interpreter and assistant in West <br>Germany, was seized by the excitement and started climbing up the wall to <br>join the party.</p><br><p><br>I grabbed him by the foot and yelled, "Not tonight! Tonight we work. Tomorrow <br>we celebrate!" And work we did. It was close to five a.m. when we finished <br>filing the stories. The historic front page of the next day`s New York Times <br>had my story with a picture across the whole page of people dancing in front <br>of the Brandenburg Gate.

But then, Tom Paine isn't your typical founding father. A firebrand rebel and a radical on the run, Paine alone claims a key role in the development of three modern democracies. In death, his story turns truly bizarre. Shunned as an infidel by every church, he had to be interred in an open field on a New York farm. Ten years later, a former enemy converting to Paine's cause dug up the bones and carried them back to Britain, where he planned to build a mausoleum in Paine's honor. But he never got around to it. So what happened to the body of this founding father? </p><p>Well, it got <i>lost. </i>Paine's missing bones, like saint's relics, have been scattered for two centuries, and their travels are the trail of radical democracy itself. Paul Collins combines wry, present-day travelogue with an odyssey down the forgotten paths of history as he searches for the remains of Tom Paine and finds them hidden in, among other places, a Paris hotel, underneath a London tailor's stool, and inside a roadside statue in New York. Along the way he crosses paths with everyone from Walt Whitman and Charles Darwin to sex reformers and hellfire ministers&#x2015;not to mention a suicidal gunman, a Ferrari dealer, and berserk feral monkeys. </p><p>In the end, Collins's search for Paine's body instead finds the soul of democracy&#x2015;for it is the story of how Paine's struggles have lived on through his eccentric and idealistic followers.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Collins</b> is the author of <i>Sixpence House</i> and <i>Not Even Wrong: A Father's Journey into the Lost History of Autism</i>. He edits the Collins Library for McSweeney's Books, and his work has appeared in <i>New Scientist</i>, the <i>Village Voice</i>, and <i>Business 2.0</i>.</p>Adult/High School&#x2013;Despite the popularity of his revolutionary essay <i>Common Sense</i>, Paine was scorned as a rebel constantly searching for a cause. When he died in 1809, no church would bury him in its cemetery, leaving his remains to be interred on his own farm. A few years later, William Cobbett, an Englishman and revolutionary in his own right, dug up the body with plans to bury it beneath a monument to be built in London. That never happened. Over the next century, those who were most influenced by his writings sought to give him a proper burial, but ultimately his remains were lost. Some names, like Thomas Edison, will be familiar. Others, like Dr. Foote, a self-help author, will not be, but provide interesting color. Paines spirit eventually influenced a number of movements, touching on everything from feminism to the Thirteen Club (its sole function&#x2013;mocking every superstition imaginable). The author does a great job of tying disparate threads together and leading them back to Paine. He intersperses the history with travel narratives detailing his own search for the remains. These sections not only showcase the unusual turns research can take, but also bring a unique sense of pacing to a history book. Highly readable and filled with enough witty anecdotes to entertain people who dont normally read history, this book is a reminder that history surrounds and influences us every day of our lives.&#x2013;Matthew L.

The enterprise was dubbed Zheng He&#39;s Seven Voyages to the Western Ocean because the Ming fleets, led by the legendary Admiral Zheng He, went to sea altogether seven times. After twenty-seven years these maritime expeditions mysteriously stopped. To date no scholar is entirely certain of the reason behind the undertaking. Although practically unknown in the West, these events made indelible impressions on the Southeast Asians. Today Admiral Zheng He is regarded as a god and is worshipped in temples not just in China, but throughout Southeast Asia. This year we see the 600th anniversary of the Ming Chinese launching of their monumental excursions, and scholars have renewed their interest in the historical events. There are speculations and assertions that the Ming fleets actually went beyond the Indian Ocean and even sailed to America-all before Christopher Columbus had made his momentous trips. However, researchers seem to be able to neither prove their hypotheses nor disprove them. In any case, it does seem odd that the Chinese, with their superior naval technology would choose to confine their activities to local waters only. Nevertheless, to prove that they did, one needs irrefutable evidence because the suggestion challenges centuries of established history. Historian/researcher Anatole Andro believes that if such evidence exists, it will need to be European evidence to prove the case. By leaving the Indian Ocean the Chinese would be entering European territory, so to speak. If confirmation to this effect is lacking it will not only fail to prove that the Chinese had sailed outside their local waters, but on the contrary, it would be as good as proof that the Ming Chinese never went beyond their traditional sphere of interest. For two and a half years the author searched for such evidence, examining each piece of suspected artifact and following up on every lead. Not only was he able to uncover such evidence he found the evidence to be widespread. Further, scholars had examined such evidence and either discarded, ignored, or obscured it. This book is the presentation of Mr. Andro&#39;s research data, his analyses of the data thereof, and the startling but inevitable conclusions that he arrived at. Written in easy to understand language, this book challenges you to accept his findings or dispute it. In either case it is a thrill ride.</p><p></p><h2>Cold Tuscan Stone (Rick Montoya Italian Mysteries)</h2><p><p>Rick Montoya has moved from New Mexico to Rome, embracing the life of a translator.

However, much of his work also reflects the influence of the extraordinary light, colour, shapes and textures to be found in the garden and landscape surrounding his house in Cornwall. He has vigorously pursued the ideal of an art of pure visual sensation. As far back as 1962 he explicitly claimed that 'colour is both the subject and the means, the form and the content, the image and the meaning, in my painting today'.<br>In this catalogue, published to accompany the major retrospective at the Tate Gallery, over seventy paintings by the artist are reproduced as colour plates. These works range from small oils to enormous canvases. Selected by David Sylvester, the curator of the exhibition, they trace the developments in Heron's style over sixty years.</p><p>Mel Gooding is an author and journalist who has written extensively on contemporary art and artists. His books include Bruce McLean, John Hoyland and William Alsop: Buildings and Projects.British artist Heron's paintings, drenched in light and color, confirm him as a colorist of genius and an original who resists categorization. Born in 1920 and residing mostly in Celtic Cornwall since 1956, Heron turned to abstraction in the mid-1950s, with a purely sensuous apprehension of color, space and shape that recalls his idols Matisse, Bonnard and Braque, yet he has restlessly experimented in his own idioms. His juicy biomorphic compositions of the past 16 years shimmer with atmospheric pyrotechnics yet are amazingly relaxed, even serene. In the 1970s he unreeled oceanic stretches of color, seeking what he called a "full emptiness." His joyfully anarchic '60s canvases, featuring orbs, discs and squares that collide, nudge, hover, envelop or invade, invite the eye and the mind to play. In this stunningly illustrated monograph, art critic Gooding sensitively explores a dynamic body of work unfamiliar to most American art lovers. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tales of the Witch World 3</h2><p>A third collection of tales, set in Andre Norton&#39;s magical Witch World, features the contributions of Marta Randall, Patricia A.

T. Wright says that when he was a young man he served as the chaplain at a university. He often encountered students who would tell him right off the bat that they didn&#x2019;t believe in God, hoping to be rid of him for the next four years. But Wright wouldn&#x2019;t let them off the hook so easily. &#x201c;Which God don&#x2019;t you believe in?&#x201d; he would ask. This usually took them by surprise and got them to think for a minute. Most of them then described the God they didn&#x2019;t believe in. Almost always this non-God was something of a dyspeptic, white-bearded curmudgeon who sat on a cloud and hurled thunderbolts at anyone who seemed to be having fun. Wright would listen to their description and then respond that he didn&#x2019;t believe in that God either. A conversation often ensued in which the idea of who God really is&#x2013;and who God isn&#x2019;t&#x2013;was more deeply explored.<br><br>Q: Before I ask you who God is, could I ask you another question first?<br>A: Of course! You can ask anything you want, remember? That&#x2019;s the whole point of the book!<br><br>Q: Okay. Where did God come from?<br>A: Um, actually, I meant to say you can ask any question <i>except that one.<br></i><br>Q: Why? If we assume God exists, it shouldn&#x2019;t be hard to explain where he came from.<br>A: Well, no one knows for sure, but we&#x2019;re looking into it. Okay?<br><br>Q: Already with the joking?<br>A: What if I told you we suspect he came from Canada?<br><br>Q: Can you be serious?<br>A: Sorry. But this is one of those frustrating questions that elude an easy answer. Even to <i>try </i>answering it, I have to get into some heavy concepts. I just feel it&#x2019;s a little early in the book to get so heavy. <br><br>Q: If it gets too heavy, I can always skip ahead to the next section, can&#x2019;t I?<br>A: I suppose so.<br><br>Q: Well?<br>A: Okay, here goes. The first thing we have to understand when we ask a question like where did God come from is that God exists outside of time and space.2 In fact, in case you hadn&#x2019;t heard, he created time and space.<br><br>Q: Yes, I&#x2019;d heard that.<br>A: And of course we exist <i>inside </i>time and space. So if God is outside time and space, and we are inside them, then trying to figure out where God came from gets pretty complicated. It&#x2019;s certainly more complicated than trying to figure out where, say, Barry Manilow was born.<br><br>Q: Then I&#x2019;ll assume Barry Manilow is not God?<br>A: Not that Barry Manilow is not an amazing performer! But, no, he&#x2019;s not God. And so when we&#x2019;re talking about God and where he came from, we can&#x2019;t just say Canada or Paramus. It&#x2019;s not that simple. However, there is one thing we <i>can </i>say, and that is that God always existed. He existed before time existed and before the universe existed. He had to, since he&#x2019;s the one who created time and space. He&#x2019;s eternal, and he exists in eternity, which is a completely different dimension, if not several other dimensions.<br><br>Q: Okay, so what kind of a world was it before time and space existed?<br>A: I&#x2019;m not sure there was a world. But whatever it was like, we know there were no watches.<br><br>Q: Because there was no time.<br>A: Bingo. And no closets, because there was no space. Ha. But beyond that, we&#x2019;re kind of stumped. On this question, we face almost exactly the same difficulty that scientists face in trying to understand what existed before the so-called Big Bang, which is when they say time and space began.<br><br>Q: And who or what do they say was behind the Big Bang?<br>A: They can be very touchy on that subject. Let&#x2019;s just say it happened, okay?<br><br>Q: But what were you saying about scientists being stumped by what happened before time and space existed?<br>A: I was saying that scientists can theoretically look back to the very first fraction of a fraction of a second when the Big Bang happened&#x2013;and can describe what the universe was<br>like in its first few moments. But they can&#x2019;t go back <i>before </i>then. They hit a wall, so to speak. It&#x2019;s what scientists call a &#x201c;singularity,&#x201d; a point beyond which it&#x2019;s impossible to go. And to get back to your question about where God came from, when we look for an answer to that question, we hit a similar wall.<br><br>Q: So we&#x2019;re stuck.<br>A: Yes. You and I can&#x2019;t see before the beginning of time and space any more than a scientist can. But we can know that, according to the Bible, God existed before then because he exists outside time and space.<br><br>Q: You were right. This is kind of heavy for the beginning of the book.<br>A: Well, you could have skipped ahead.<br><br>Q: Okay, now that we got that out of the way, who exactly is God?<br>A: In one sense, this is an odd question. God is God. But so many people mean different things when they say &#x201c;God&#x201d; that it&#x2019;s important to clarify his identity if we can.<br><br>Q: Right. So who is he?<br>A: Well, I assume we&#x2019;re talking about the God of the Bible, and the God of the Bible actually has many names. Usually he&#x2019;s called Jehovah, which is just another way of saying Yahweh.<br><br>Q: But can&#x2019;t I use whatever name I like? And why do I even have to use the word God? What about Energy or The Force or something like that?<br>A: First of all, if we&#x2019;re talking about the God of the Bible, we&#x2019;re talking about a God for whom names are extremely important. In fact, in a few places in the Bible, when something significant happens to a person, God gives that person a new name. In the book of Genesis, after God reveals himself to Abram, he changes Abram&#x2019;s name to Abraham. And in the New Testament, Jesus tells Simon that his new name will be Peter, which means &#x201c;rock.&#x201d;3 Those are just two examples. Names have a lot of meaning in the Bible, so we&#x2019;d have to assume that God wants us to take his name seriously too.<br><br>Q: If you say so.<br>A: In fact, many Jewish people take God&#x2019;s name so seriously that they won&#x2019;t even write or say the word <i>Yahweh, </i>because for them the name of God is holy. They can write it without the vowels, using just the four consonants, but they will never write out the whole word.<br><br>Q: But Christians are free to say it and write it?<br>A: Yes, but for Christians too, God&#x2019;s name is holy. In the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, when Jesus prays to God the Father, he says, &#x201c;Hallowed be thy name.&#x201d; <i>Hallowed </i>is another word for &#x201c;holy,&#x201d; so Jesus himself is pointing out that God&#x2019;s name is holy and that we should acknowledge that when we pray. We&#x2019;ll come back to what holiness means later, but the point is that we are supposed to take God&#x2019;s name very seriously. There is power in every name, and especially in God&#x2019;s name. In the Old Testament, it was said that the one who comes &#x201c;in the name of the LORD&#x201d; is blessed, and when Jesus entered Jerusalem before he was crucified, the people lining the streets identified him as &#x201c;he who comes in the name of the Lord!&#x201d; If you&#x2019;re around Christians, you will often hear them pray &#x201c;in Jesus&#x2019; name.&#x201d; The name itself has power and authority. If you were in a country that had a monarchy and someone said, &#x201c;I come in the name of the king!&#x201d; his words would have the same effect as if the king himself were standing there. His authority would be present in an emissary who comes in the king&#x2019;s name. It&#x2019;s just like that when we use the name of God. God&#x2019;s authority is somehow present in his name, which is another reason the Ten Commandments forbid taking God&#x2019;s name in vain. God&#x2019;s name is too holy and too important to throw around lightly.<br><br>Q: While we&#x2019;re on the subject, what exactly does it mean to &#x201c;take God&#x2019;s name in vain&#x201d;?<br>A: Most folks think it means swearing, but taking God&#x2019;s name in vain means using God&#x2019;s name lightly&#x2013;whether you say &#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; when you slam your finger in a car door or whether you simply say &#x201c;God!&#x201d; when you are horrified at something. If we really understood how holy and powerful God&#x2019;s name is, we would never use it lightly, or &#x201c;take his name in vain,&#x201d; to use the old-fashioned term. As I said, this goes far beyond swearing. We are supposed to revere God&#x2019;s name, but most people in our culture have completely lost sight of what that means. The Bible makes it very clear that there is power in God&#x2019;s name. Demons tremble and cower at God&#x2019;s name. You have to wonder what they know that we don&#x2019;t.<br><br>Q: I understand the idea that God&#x2019;s name is important. But I&#x2019;m still not sure why he can&#x2019;t be called whatever we want to call him.<br>A: One reason is that God can&#x2019;t be whoever we want him to be. We have to know who we&#x2019;re talking about when we&#x2019;re talking about God. He can&#x2019;t be some entity that we&#x2019;ve made up, a God created in our own image, so to speak. He&#x2019;s real; he&#x2019;s not just an idea. But let&#x2019;s try something. Tell me who you have in mind when you&#x2019;re talking about God, and maybe we can figure out who you mean. <br><br>Q: Well, I know that if he&#x2019;s God, he has to be good. And loving. And he has to be fair. <br>A: That rules out calling him Satan, right? Or Lucifer or Mephistopheles or Beelzebub. Just in case you wondered if any of those names might qualify. You see how names are important? Okay, what else would you say to describe God?<br><br>Q: He&#x2019;s kind, and he cares deeply about the poor and the suffering. <br>A: Okay, that rules out most Hindu gods.<br><br>Q: Really?<br>A: Yes, absolutely. It also rules out the ancient Greek and Roman gods and the Egyptian gods. In fact, it rules out all the pagan gods. Zeus and Thoth and Ra and Neptune and Mars and Venus and that whole gang are not on any level interested in the poor and the suffering. What else?<br><br>Q: When I say &#x201c;God,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m thinking about someone who cares about me&#x2013;and keeps his eye on me.<br>A: Well, that definitely rules out The Force or any impersonal deities along those lines, which are closer to a kind of Eastern or New Age version of God. Eastern religions and New Age religions don&#x2019;t have in mind a God who is a person and who created us in his image. Their idea of God isn&#x2019;t a deity who knows you and knows what you&#x2019;re going through and cares about your difficulties. So far the God you&#x2019;re describing is definitely the God of the Bible. No other God meets your description. And as I said earlier, his name is Jehovah and Yahweh. He has a lot of other names, but the bottom line is that now we know who we are talking about and who we&#x2019;re not talking about.<br><br>Q: What does Jehovah mean? Or Yahweh?<br>A: In the book of Exodus when Moses encounters the burning bush and talks to God, Moses asks God who he is. In giving his name, God speaks the Hebrew word <i>Yahweh</i>&#x2013;what we sometimes call <i>Jehovah. </i>It is best translated as &#x201c;I AM&#x201d; or &#x201c;I AM WHO I AM.&#x201d;<br><br>Q: That&#x2019;s not much of a translation. In fact it sounds more like a riddle than a name.<br>A: It really is hard to translate, but <i>Yahweh </i>means something like &#x201c;I am who I am&#x201d; or &#x201c;he who will always be.&#x201d;<br><br>Q: That doesn&#x2019;t do much to clear this up.<br>A: Well, all these phrases carry the superimportant idea that God is self-existent and eternal, which takes us back to where we started. He&#x2019;s the God who is outside time and space and who has always existed. But he communicates with us, who are inside time and space. That right there is really at the core of who God is. He&#x2019;s the God who leaves eternity and enters time because he wants to connect with us&#x2013;whom he loves. It&#x2019;s all through the Bible. We see it happening when he tells Abram to leave his home and set out on a journey to who knows where. And we see it when Moses encounters God at the burning bush. Of course, we see it most obviously and most dramatically when Jesus came into the world. When Jesus entered time and space, he changed human history forever. It&#x2019;s all pretty heavy, the more you think about it.<br><br>Q: Heavier than I thought, that&#x2019;s for sure.<br>A: It&#x2019;s crucial to know that God is real and that he can&#x2019;t and won&#x2019;t be just whoever we want him to be. It&#x2019;s up to each of us to find out who he is and what he&#x2019;s like. The idea is that we are supposed to get to know him and become more and more like him. But instead of doing that, we sometimes try to make God more like us. That&#x2019;s backward. He is who he is, and what we want him to be or not be isn&#x2019;t going to change him. Unlike, say, Mr. Potato Head.<br><br>Q: Okay, how exactly is God not like Mr. Potato Head?<br>A: With Mr. Potato Head, we accept the basic shape, but the rest is up to us. And of course we make him look the way we want by putting on whichever hat and glasses and eyebrows we like best.<br><br>Q: I always use the little pipe.<br>A: Whatever. The point is that we&#x2019;re supposed to do that with Mr. Potato Head, but if we try it with God, it won&#x2019;t work. We can&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;I like the part about his being good and just and loving, so I&#x2019;ll start there. But I&#x2019;ll change the part about his telling me what to do with my body or telling me that all religions aren&#x2019;t equal.&#x201d; With God, we have to take the whole package. If he truly is God, and if he loves us and knows us, then we can trust him with the things that might puzzle us or rub us the wrong way. If he&#x2019;s God, we have to deal with him as he is, not as we want him to be.<br><br>Q: But just handing over control to a God you can&#x2019;t even see can be a bit frightening.<br>A: Right, but if we don&#x2019;t, we are effectively saying that we&#x2019;re in control, which is like putting ourselves in God&#x2019;s place. If we want to know who God is, we have to understand that we&#x2019;re not him. We answer to God, not vice versa. But the good news is that he really is God. So we can relax and trust him. He is the source of all beauty and joy and goodness and truth and justice. So even if there is something about the God of the Bible that makes us uncomfortable, we can still trust him with the things we&#x2019;re not sure about. If he&#x2019;s really God, we can let him challenge us and change us, and we can know that we&#x2019;ll be moving in the right direction, toward being more like God, becoming more full of love and truth and justice.<br><br>Q: So we&#x2019;ve determined that I&#x2019;m not God.<br>A: Yes. And of course we&#x2019;ve also determined that Barry Manilow&#x2013;great as he is&#x2013;is not God. Knowing who God is <i>not </i>can be the most important step toward understanding who God really is. Many of us spend years feeling resentful or indifferent toward a God who, in the end, never existed at all. If not for the joy of eventually discovering who God really is, it could all be very embarrassing.</p><h2>French Knot Pictures (Milner Craft Series)</h2><p>This text provides a guide to using the French knot technique in various embroidery projects.

As the special investigator to the Lord Chancellor's Visitor in Lunacy, Becker is charged with investigating "the psychology of anyone with a fortune or an income that might be put at risk by their erratic behavior." When a fatal arson at a Sussex theater claims the life of a German prince, Becker's superior is eager for him to demolish any claim that the prime suspect, showman William James, was insane when he set the fire. After meeting James, Becker is prepared to give some credence to the man's claims of innocence. That comes back to haunt him when James manipulates him into facilitating his escape, leading the detective on a search for the fugitive--and the truth--that takes him to Pennsylvania and an apparent dead end.

Lippard weaves together cultural criticism, anthropology, and community activism for an in-depth look at how tourism sites are conceived and represented, and how they affect the places they transform. Critic Andrew Ross calls Lippard &#x201c;the most surefooted tour guide you could hope for&#x201d; in her exploration of being a tourist in one&#x2019;s own home, of how advertising and photography define place, of how antique shops function as populist museums, and of the commodification of indigenous cultures. With her characteristic breadth and critical eye, Lippard discusses the political economies of leisure spaces, the tourist&#x2019;s fascination with tragic destinations (such as the sites of massacres and nuclear weapons tests, or Holocaust memorials), and our willingness to let national parks and heritage sites define nature and history.</p> <br></p><p>Lucy R. Lippard is an internationally known writer, activist, and curator. She has authored twenty-three books, has curated more than fifty major exhibitions, and holds nine honorary doctorates of fine arts.

Lippard is the recipient of numerous awards, most recently the Carolyn Bancroft History Prize from the Denver Public Library and grants from Creative Capital and the Lannan Foundation. She lives in New Mexico.<br>A lively essay in cultural geography that delves into the question of how tourist attractions are invented and sold. There's something about the phenomenon of ``rubbernecking,'' scorned by literary travel writers, that appeals to art critic Lippard (The Lure of the Local, 1997); rubbernecking, the evil opposite of sophisticated travel, ``implies a willingness or desire on the part of the tourist to stretch, literally, past her own experience, to lean forward in anticipation, engagement, amazement, or horror.'' Amazement and horror are key words, for, Lippard continues, domestic tourists like nothing quite so much as to visit the sites of massacres or bloody battles, to say nothing of strip mines, Wild West cemeteries, alligator farms, and other monuments to violence and mayhem. They come to the west, Lippard writes with inspired overstatement, ``looking for places destroyed by shifting economies: Indian ruins, ghost towns, abandoned farms, deserted mines, and nineteenth-century spaces frozen in the governmentally managed wildernesses''; they go (or went, before the cleanup) to New York to gawk at the city's bad seed in Times Square; they go to popular museums across the land to take in weird dioramas and improbable interpretations of history. Lippard gets a little scattershot at times, spending much of her narrative on performance and plastic art that few domestic tourists would ever care to see; but she has a fine, irreverent style and an eye for the bizarre, complemented by dozens of well-chosen photographs to back her points. Above all, she has fun with her subject, as when she writes of an Armageddon theme park now under construction outside Tel Aviv and slated to be finished in 2000. The park, she says, ``is aimed at fundamentalist Christians who believe Christ will arrive for his second coming in the year 2007a lot of work for a park that will last only seven years.'' Lippard's leisurely stroll through some of the wackier venues of our day makes for enjoyable reading. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It was feared that sorcerers were roaming the land, clipping off the ends of men's queues (the braids worn by royal decree), and chanting magical incantations over them in order to steal the souls of their owners. In a fascinating chronicle of this epidemic of fear and the official prosecution of soulstealers that ensued, Philip Kuhn provides an intimate glimpse into the world of eighteenth-century China. </p><p> Kuhn weaves his exploration of the sorcery cases with a survey of the social and economic history of the era. Drawing on a rich repository of documents found in the imperial archives, he presents in detail the harrowing interrogations of the accused--a ragtag assortment of vagabonds, beggars, and roving clergy--conducted under torture by provincial magistrates. In tracing the panic's spread from peasant hut to imperial court, Kuhn unmasks the political menace lurking behind the queue-clipping scare as well as the complex of folk beliefs that lay beneath popular fears of sorcery. </p><p> Kuhn shows how the campaign against sorcery provides insight into the period's social structure and ethnic tensions, the relationship between monarch and bureaucrat, and the inner workings of the state. Whatever its intended purposes, the author argues, the campaign offered Hungli a splendid chance to force his provincial chiefs to crack down on local officials, to reinforce his personal supremacy over top bureaucrats, and to restate the norms of official behavior. </p><p> This wide-ranging narrative depicts life in imperial China as it was actually lived, often in the participants' own words. <i>Soulstealers</i> offers a compelling portrait of the Chinese people--from peasant to emperor--and of the human condition. </p></p><p><b>Philip A.

Only, this time it was different. . . .</i></b> <br> <br> Faith has always been a loner. Growing up in a broken home in South Boston, shuffled from relative to relative, her only companion was an imaginary friend named Alex, who helped her escape into a fantasy world of monsters and the supernatural, far from the real-life horrors of the waking world. <br> <br> Now, taken away from her mother by social services and shipped off to a foster home, Faith learns that some nightmares are all too real, that the inventions of her childhood really do haunt the night, hungry for blood. Enter Diana Dormer, a Harvard professor and representative of the Watchers Council who has come to tell Faith of her destiny, to train her, to prepare her for what is to come: Faith is the Chosen One. She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of darkness. <br> <br> But she's not alone. When Alex, her childhood companion, returns in her dreams, she warns Faith that someone else is coming for her, a force so deadly and unforgiving that it has inspired fear in the underworld for a thousand generations. Its name is Malice. <br> <br> As memory and fantasy begin to merge, Faith's two worlds collide, with cataclysmic results. A violent battle for the Slayer's soul is staged, winner take all. <br> <br> This is her story. . . .</p><p></p><h2>The Jesus Sutras</h2><p>In 1907, in a remote region of China, explorers discovered a vast treasure trove of ancient scrolls. Dating from the 5th to 11th centuries AD, they recounted a Taoist interpretation of Jesus&#39;s life and teachings. In this volume, theologist Martin Palmer provides a history and translation of these sacred texts. The work: recounts the story of the first Christian missions to China; explains how the Church of the East blended Eastern and Western spiritual principles, and how Jesus became a Buddha Christ; details the contents of each of the sutras; tells the story of the Taoist Christians and their teachings; and recounts Martin Palmer&#39;s rediscovery of one of the earliest Taoist Christian monasteries, an intact 8th-century pagoda, and its amazing statues and artefacts.</p><p>Martin Palmer is a theologian, Chinese scholar and Director of the International Consultancy on Religion, Education and Culture (ICOREC). He is a regular broadcaster on the BBC, both TV and radio, and is the author of several books, including Living Christianity and Yin and Yang, and co-author, with Nigel Palmer, of Sacred Britain and with David Manning, Sacred Gardens (also Piatkus). He is a religious adviser to Prince Philip and Worldwide Fund for Nature, and has worked with churches in more than 30 countries. He lives in Manchester.</p><h2>The Lives of the Mughal Emperors</h2><p>One of the most powerful of all the world&#x2019;s great dynasties, the Mughals ruled India for over three hundred years. Beginning in 1526, the first six emperors&#x2014;Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb&#x2014;invaded, lost, regained, and greatly expanded an empire that at its peak covered most of preindependent India. But the later rulers were seriously overstretched, increasingly lacking authority, resources, or ability, and by the time the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed in 1857, the once-great dynasty held power over just the Red Fort in Delhi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>The Lives of the Mughal Emperors</i>, John Reeve tells the individual stories of the Mughal emperors and other key officials through the art that was produced at the time. The Mughals were great patrons of the arts, and Reeve reveals them to be not only an enormously powerful dynasty but also one beset by problems of opium and alcohol addiction, brutal familial infighting, and territorial pressures from other political powers. A beautifully illustrated introduction to the Mughal period, this volume will appeal to anyone interested in how the Mughals built and then lost a great empire.</p><p><b>John Reeve </b>was formerly Head of Education at the British Museum and now teaches at the Institute of Education, University of London.

Blending history, memoir, digressive literariness, and polemic, Kauffman provides fresh portaiture of such American originals as Catholic Worker founder Dorothy Day, regionalist painter Grant Wood, farmer-writer Wendell Berry, publisher Henry Regnery, maverick U.S. senators Eugene McCarthy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and other Americans who can&#x2019;t&#x2014;or shouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;be filed away in the usual boxes labeled &#x201c;liberal&#x201d; and &#x201c;conservative.&#x201d; Ranging from Millard Fillmore to <i>Easy Rider,</i> from Robert Frost to Mother Jones, Kauffman limns an alternative America that draws its breath from local cultures, traditional liberties, small-scale institutions, and neighborliness. There is an America left that is worth saving: these are its paragons, its poets, its pantheon.</p><p><b>Bill Kauffman</b> is the author of five books, most recently the localist manifesto <i>Dispatches from the Muckdog Gazette,</i> which won the 2003 national &#x201c;Sense of Place&#x201d; award from <i>Writers &amp; Books.</i> His other books include a novel, a travel book, and works about American isolationists and critics of progress. He writes for the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> the <i>American Enterprise, Counterpunch,</i> and the <i>American Conservative, </i>among other publications. Kauffman lives in his native Genesee County, New York, with his wife Lucine and their daughter Gretel.<br><br>Other Titles by Bill Kauffman:<br><br><i>Dispatches from the Muckdog Gazette: A Mostly Affectionate Account of a Small Town's Fight to Survive,</i> Bill&nbsp;Kauffman, Henry Holt &amp; Company, March&nbsp;2004.&nbsp;<i>With Good Intentions?: Reflections on the Myth of Progress in America</i>, Bill&nbsp;Kauffman, Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated, October&nbsp;1998.*Starred Review* "I am an American patriot," Kauffman begins, and after less than a paragraph of his customary fine, funny, dead-on-the-money phrasing about what that entails, does his first finger-pointing at role models: "I am the love child of Henry Thoreau and Dorothy Day." Dorothy who? (Please don't ask, "Henry who?") In chapter 2, Kauffman shiningly profiles that extraordinary pacifist activist, cofounder of the Catholic Worker Movement and the closest thing to St. Francis America has ever seen. He has already sketched two ex-senators he admires, Eugene McCarthy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and revealed why McCarthy was better: Moynihan was a truth teller like McCarthy but also, finally, a political coward. Kauffman's marvelous trick of praising to the skies and then noting shortcomings and even vices increases the fascination of his remarks on such defenders of "family, community, [and] local self-rule" as Wendell Berry, Grant Wood, Carolyn Chute, Millard Fillmore ("ranks with the Quaker Herbert Hoover as the most pacific president"), as well as more obscure figures. More marvelous is that Kauffman, who freely injects himself into his prose, treats himself the same way; he vaunts his stance on something and then acknowledges his contradictions on the same matter. If figures he considers overrated don't get the same treatment, well, that helps keep things snappy. His writing persona couldn't be more appealing. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

One way is by practicing the communion of saints. However, not only has devotion to the saints suffered an extraordinary decline wherever Western secular culture has gained a foothold, but, surprisingly, the communion of saints is one of the least developed symbols in all theology. This dearth of a well-developed, integrated approach in theology contrasts with the lively interest in saints in other disciplines such as social history and psychology.<p>In Friends of God and Prophets, Elizabeth Johnson provides such a theology of the communion of saints, utilizing, ironically, women's practices of memory -- "ironically" because the official list of saints is largely dominated by men, and "women's history of holiness has been neither remembered nor truthfully told". In the first part of the book, Johnson dialogues with history, gleaning clues from the past for an understanding of the communion of saints that is both faithful to tradition and promising of liberation. In the second, she.offers a systematic interpretation of the symbol, connecting insights from history with insights arising from women's practices today, linking both with radical hope in God. In this way, the communion of saints can become a practical doctrine for the entire church: a source of strength in the work to create a transformed society of mutuality and compassionate respect, both among human beings and between human beings and the Earth.</p></p><p>Elizabeth A. Johnson, C.S.J., is distinguished Professor of Theology at Fordham University. She has received numerous awards, including the Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion for She Who Is (1993), the American Academy of Religion Award for Excellence in the Study of Religion for Friends of God and Prophets (1999), and the Book Award of the College Theology Society for Truly Our Sister (2004). She was also the recipient of the John Courtney Murray Award of the Catholic Theological Society of America, the Jerome Award of the Catholic Library Association, and the Monika K.

Paul R. McHugh and Phillip R. Slavney offer an approach that emphasizes psychiatry's unifying concepts while accommodating its diversity. Recognizing that there may never be a single, all-encompassing theory, the book distills psychiatric practice into four explanatory methods: diseases, dimensions of personality, goal-directed behaviors, and life stories. These perspectives, argue the authors, underlie the principles and practice of all psychiatry. With an understanding of these fundamental methods, readers will be equipped to organize and evaluate psychiatric information and to develop a confident approach to practice and research.</p><p>Praise for the original edition:</p><p>"This brilliant book illuminates psychiatry more clearly than any other work I know....

Between 1600 and 1800, this entire world-view was shattered by revolutionary new ideas - that consenting adults have the freedom to do what they like with their own bodies, and morality cannot be imposed by force. This groundbreaking book shows that the creation of this modern culture of sex - broadcasted and debated in a rapidly expanding universe of public media - was a central part of the Enlightenment, and helped create a new model of western civilization whose principles of equality, privacy and individual freedom last to this day.</p><p>Faramerz Dabhoiwala was born in England, grew up in Amsterdam, and was educated at York and Oxford. He is the Senior Fellow in History at Exeter College, Oxford, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and the father of two children. This is his first book.In this significant historical debut, Faramerz Dabhoiwala presents his readers with a revelation: how early, and how suddenly, the permissive society arrived in Christian Western Europe.Over three centuries ago a revolution took place in Western attitudes to sex; it began in England, but all modern Westerners are its heirs, and now it is challenging and remoulding patterns of sexual behaviour throughout the world.The book is not simply a finely-crafted work of history, but a study that will reshape the way its readers understand the most intimate level of their lives.It may even bring some sanity to modern debates about sexuality. -- Diarmaid Macculloch In this brilliantly argued, lucid and enthralling book, Faramerz Dabhoiwala describes the first sexual revolution - a sea change in attitudes towards sexual morality, the public and the private. The Origins of Sex shows how far men enjoyed, and women endured, the new sexual world.

First released by The University of Massachusetts Press in 1981, this Quirin Press Revised Edition brings back into print this classic of Western sinology and offers the full original text with the following features: � Older Wade-Giles transliteration fully updated and revised to Pinyin. � Fully re-typeset and proofed for typographical errors and inconsistencies. � Expanded index including Chinese characters. &#34;It is largely thanks to [Maspero&#39;s] pioneer work in the fields of Chinese religion, anthropology, linguistics and history that China&#39;s contribution to the achievement of man could first be reviewed on terms of parity with those of other civilizations. &#34;To the question whether his discoveries, opinions and interpretations have been outdated by the subsequent thirty years&#39; research, it may be answered that leading scholars still rely with the utmost confidence on his writings as a framework whose validity has outdated their most recent findings, and whose detail has in many cases not been bettered.&#34; -Michael Loewe, University of Cambridge (from the sleeve-note to the original 1981 edition) Maspero (1883-1945) was the first Western scholar to study the vast and recondite compendium of Daoist writing, the Daozang, and explore its historic meaning. The first part of the book closely examines Chinese society, religion, and folk-myth; the second part specifically focuses on the practice and form of Daoism and includes an extensive investigation of yoga-like procedures of nutrition, breathing exercises, and sexual techniques-all designed to ensure personal immortality in ancient Daoism. The titles of the nine &#34;books&#34; comprising this study give an indication of its breadth and variety: Chinese Religion in Its Historical Development; The Mythology of Modern China; The Society and Religion of the Ancient Chinese and of the Modern Tai; How Was Buddhism Introduced into China?; Daoism in Chinese Religious Beliefs of the Six Dynasties Period; The Poet Xi Kang and the Club of Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove; An Essay on Daoism in the First Centuries CE; How to Communicate with the Daoist Gods; Methods of &#34;Nourishing the Vital Principle&#34; in the Ancient Daoist Religion.

Yet the editor of The Alpine Advocate, Emma Lord, knows all too well that the picturesque old logging town is loaded with scandal: family feuds, illicit romance, chicanery, and sometimes deadly violence.<br><br>THE ALPINE RECLUSE<br><br>In the middle of a hot midsummer night, Emma is awakened by fire trucks rushing to a blaze at the nearby home of newlyweds Tim and Tiffany Rafferty. At daybreak, Tiffany and her unborn child are safe, but Tim, never blessed with good luck in all his thirty-plus years, has perished in the fierce conflagration. Sheriff Milo Dodge suspects murder and arson, and rumors fly from the Burger Barn and Mugs Ahoy to the Grocery Basket and the Venison Inn. Some swear the Rafferty marriage was crumbling. Others hint at stock fraud. A few mention momentary sightings of a possibly mad recluse known as Old Nick.<br><br>Sacrificing the heady enticements of a budding romance to nail down a great story, Emma shifts into high investigative gear while her fearless House &amp; Home editor, Vida Runkel, rushes in where angels fear to tread: straight into the private lives of some of Alpine&#x2019;s most respectable&#x2013;and now terminally edgy&#x2013;citizens. But neither Emma nor Vida suspects the unbelievable truth.</p><p><b>Mary Richardson Daheim</b>&nbsp;started spinning stories before she could spell. Daheim has been a journalist, an editor, a public relations consultant, and a freelance writer, but fiction was always her medium of choice. In 1982, she launched a career that is now distinguished by more than sixty novels. In 2000, she won the Literary Achievement Award from the Pacific Northwest Writers Association. In October 2008, she was inducted into the University of Washington&#x2019;s Communication Alumni Hall of Fame. Daheim lives in her hometown of Seattle and is a direct descendant of former residents of the real Alpine, which existed as a logging town from 1910 to 1929, when it was abandoned after the mill was closed. The Alpine/Emma Lord series has created interest in the site, which was named a Washington State ghost town in July 2011. An organization called the Alpine Advocates has been formed to preserve what remains of the town as a historic site.One<br><br> If I wanted to be hot,&#x201d; I said to Leo Walsh, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d go to hell in a handcart. There&#x2019;s no reason why it should be ninety-four degrees in Alpine, even in August.&#x201d;<br><br> Leo gave me his off-center grin. &#x201c;You could always take a couple of weeks off and visit Adam in Alaska. I&#x2019;ll bet it&#x2019;s not ninety-four at St. Mary&#x2019;s Igloo.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet it isn&#x2019;t, either,&#x201d; I grumbled from across the desk in the cubbyhole that was my office but felt more like a pizza oven even at eleven in the morning. To think I was sorry for my son, Adam, when his first assignment as a priest sent him up to the Frozen North. Now I envy him. &#x201c;When will it ever rain? Everything is tinder-dry, Leo. It&#x2019;s a wonder the woods don&#x2019;t explode.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They did,&#x201d; my ad manager said in his usual wry manner. &#x201c;Or haven&#x2019;t you been checking the AP wire this morning?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have,&#x201d; I retorted. &#x201c;I mean all the woods, not the ones burning up in eastern Washington and other parts of the West. Grass fires, too. Not to mention that water and power rates are going to skyrocket because we haven&#x2019;t had enough rain, let alone snow.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you write an editorial taking a tough stand against hot weather?&#x201d; Leo inquired reasonably. &#x201c;Maybe you can change it.&#x201d;<br><br> I glared at him. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not funny. Nothing&#x2019;s funny in this heat.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Come on, Emma,&#x201d; Leo said, no longer smiling. &#x201c;At least western Washington&#x2019;s not humid like the Midwest or the eastern seaboard. Dry heat&#x2019;s not as bad. I worked on a newspaper in Palm Desert where it was over a hundred and twenty degrees for a week.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No wonder you drank,&#x201d; I snarled. &#x201c;Besides, people from southern California deserve to be hot. Native Pacific Northwesterners like me don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> Leo took no offense at my remark. We&#x2019;d known each other too long and too well not to be able to speak candidly. He merely sighed. His well-worn face showed the ravages of his former bouts with the bottle. In my heat-crazed state, I decided that he&#x2019;d also spent too much time in the sun. &#x201c;Mad dogs and Californians . . . ,&#x201d; I muttered.<br><br> &#x201c;Quit bitching and just look at the ad layout,&#x201d; Leo finally said, tapping the Grocery Basket&#x2019;s mock-up on my desk. &#x201c;Jake O&#x2019;Toole went over it with a fine-toothed thesaurus. What gets into that guy, wanting to use all those big words that half the time aren&#x2019;t what he really means?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Heat,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a native, too.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Knock it off,&#x201d; Leo retorted, temporarily forgetting that I was the boss. &#x201c;Jake&#x2019;s been doing it forever when he talks, but he started in with the grocery ads back in April. Unsullied for fresh tomatoes? Temperate for tender pork chops? Un- skeletal for boneless chicken breasts? I&#x2019;m not even sure unskeletal is a word.&#x201d;<br><br> At last, I scanned the layout. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s stupid. Jake should stop trying to show off, especially when he doesn&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;s talking about. It might be a midlife crisis. Maybe I&#x2019;ll talk to Betsy. His wife&#x2019;s a sensible woman.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Go for it,&#x201d; Leo urged, standing up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m changing this damned thing.&#x201d; He cocked his head. &#x201c;With your approval, of course.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Leo knew he didn&#x2019;t need my approval, which, I suppose, was why he occasionally forgot that I was The Alpine Advocate&#x2019;s editor and publisher. He did an excellent job, about fifty rungs above the lugubrious and lazy Ed Bronsky, a leftover ad manager from Marius Vandeventer&#x2019;s ownership.<br><br> &#x201c;Lugubrious,&#x201d; I said, and managed a smile.<br><br> &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; Layout in hand, Leo turned around to look back at me.<br><br> &#x201c;The header for the grocery ad is &#x2018;Lazy Days of Summer.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s a wonder Jake didn&#x2019;t ask you to put in lugubrious.&#x201d;<br><br> Leo grinned again. &#x201c;He did&#x2014;sort of. Only, he wanted to use lubricious.&#x201d;<br><br> I nodded. &#x201c;He would.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Would what?&#x201d; Vida Runkel inquired. Leo made way for her semimajestic passage into my cubbyhole, then left. &#x201c;Oh, goodness, it&#x2019;s even warmer in here than it is in the newsroom! Why didn&#x2019;t Kip put a vent in this low ceiling when he repaired the roof after the big storm?&#x201d;<br><br> I remembered the punishing rain and windstorm of eighteen months ago with nostalgia. &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m an idiot,&#x201d; I told my House &amp; Home editor.<br><br> Vida, who was wearing a sleeveless red and white print dress that resembled a bedspread, eased her imposing body into one of the two visitor chairs. &#x201c;Would what?&#x201d; she repeated.<br><br> I recounted Leo&#x2019;s misadventures with Jake O&#x2019;Toole.<br><br> Vida shook her head. The unruly gray curls were already damp around the edges. &#x201c;Jake hasn&#x2019;t been himself lately,&#x201d; she declared. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s much more than his pretentious&#x2014;if often inaccurate&#x2014;language. He and Betsy have stopped fighting in public.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; I was surprised. The O&#x2019;Tooles, who had been married forever, were famous for bickering in front of other people. But in fact, they were a devoted couple who used their often heated exchanges as a sort of lovemaking. &#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;re having problems?&#x201d; Vida would know. She knew everything that went on in Alpine.<br><br> She gave me a quizzical look from behind her big-framed glasses. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really think so. It has more to do with the store. Staff, I&#x2019;d guess. Jake&#x2019;s had to fire at least two of his courtesy clerks in the past month. High school students, you know, and quite irresponsible. And of course there&#x2019;s always Buzzy.&#x201d;<br><br> Buzzy was Jake&#x2019;s younger brother who had had a somewhat checkered career until he finally went to work for the Grocery Basket as the produce manager. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Buzzy now?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Now?&#x201d; Vida pursed her lips. &#x201c;I honestly don&#x2019;t know. It might be trouble at home with Laura. The only thing I&#x2019;ve heard for certain is that Buzzy had a row with their peach supplier, and that he ordered Ugli fruit, which no one in Alpine would dream of eating because it&#x2019;s so . . . ugly. It all rotted in the bins. I was tempted to mention it in my column, but I didn&#x2019;t want to hurt the O&#x2019;Tooles&#x2019; feelings.&#x201d;<br><br> I was dubious. Vida didn&#x2019;t usually worry about hurting other people&#x2019;s feelings, being extremely outspoken in her criticism of fellow Alpiners. The O&#x2019;Tooles, however, were big advertisers, buying a two-page color insert to compete with the regionally produced ads of their archrival, Safeway.<br><br> &#x201c;Which reminds me,&#x201d; Vida went on, &#x201c;have you a &#x2018;Scene&#x2019; item? I only need two more for this week&#x2019;s edition.&#x201d;<br><br> I tried to put my heat-hazed brain to work. &#x201c;Scene Around Town&#x201d; was Vida&#x2019;s popular front-page column fea- turing snippets of local happenings, involving usually nonnewsworthy events such as Dutch Bamberg&#x2019;s lawn mower accidentally executing a hapless frog, Edna Mae Dalrymple discovering fudge smudges on a cookbook that had been returned to the local library, or Darla Puckett&#x2019;s zany adventures at the Home Depot&#x2019;s faucet fixtures section in Monroe.<br><br> &#x201c;Rip Ridley&#x2019;s growing a beard,&#x201d; I finally said. &#x201c;I saw him at the Alpine Mall yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br> Vida gaped at me. &#x201c;Impossible! The high school would never allow a faculty member to have facial hair. Except,&#x201d; she added more softly, &#x201c;for Effie Trews, but she can&#x2019;t help it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;School hasn&#x2019;t started,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;Rip swears he won&#x2019;t shave until the football team wins its first game this season.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, dear.&#x201d; Vida sighed. &#x201c;He could end up looking like Santa Claus. Principal Freeman will make the coach shave before school starts. Which reminds me&#x2014;I saw Old Nick Saturday morning. Imagine!&#x201d;<br><br> For a moment, I was puzzled. &#x201c;Old Nick?&#x201d; Then, before Vida could respond, I remembered. &#x201c;You mean that hermit who lives someplace near Sawyer Creek?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Some place,&#x201d; Vida said wryly. &#x201c;No one has ever been certain. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s been seen in town for several years. Frankly, I thought he was dead.&#x201d;<br><br> Hermits weren&#x2019;t uncommon in the forests of western Washington. Most were harmless, though some could be dangerous. They&#x2019;d fled civilization for various reasons, like monks going off to the desert. A few would show up in town a couple of times a year to buy, beg, or steal supplies. But Old Nick was rarely seen. Indeed, in all of my thirteen years of Alpine residence, I&#x2019;d never sighted him.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put him in &#x2018;Scene,&#x2019; &#x201d; Vida declared. &#x201c;That should fill up the column. Unless something more gossip-worthy comes up between now and tomorrow&#x2019;s deadline.&#x201d;<br><br> My eyes had strayed into the newsroom. &#x201c;Something just came in,&#x201d; I groaned. &#x201c;Ed Bronsky.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, dear!&#x201d; Vida exclaimed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re trapped.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; I whispered as Ed rumbled toward my office. &#x201c;Go, or else there won&#x2019;t be enough air in here for the three of us to breathe.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Plenty of hot air,&#x201d; Vida murmured, hurriedly getting out of the chair. &#x201c;Why, Ed! What a surprise! I was just leaving. So was Emma.&#x201d;<br><br> Bless Vida. &#x201c;Bad timing,&#x201d; I said, forcing a smile. &#x201c;Is there something you&#x2019;d like to drop off, Ed?&#x201d; Like about a hundred pounds of excess weight?<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, hey, hey,&#x201d; Ed enthused, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s more than a news brief. It&#x2019;s front-page stuff. You&#x2019;d better hold up, Vida. You won&#x2019;t want to miss this.&#x201d;<br><br> Vida frowned at her watch. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ll have to. I&#x2019;m already running late for my eleven-thirty appointment. Emma can fill me in later.&#x201d; With a pitying glance in my direction, Vida exited my office in her splayfooted manner.<br><br> Ed plopped down in the chair next to the one that Vida had vacated. He was wearing a yellow tank top and khaki shorts, a most unflattering look. But the only thing that would have covered Ed&#x2019;s rotund form was a Quonset hut.<br><br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s reporting on tonight&#x2019;s county commissioners&#x2019; meeting?&#x201d; he asked, removing a folder from his leather briefcase.<br><br> &#x201c;Scott Chamoud,&#x201d; I replied, referring to my only news reporter. &#x201c;He always does.&#x201d;<br><br> Ed shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better do it, Emma. Huge news.&#x201d; He placed the folder on my desk and tapped it three times. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going for a county bond issue.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re what?&#x201d;</p><h2>Uncommon Women and Others.

Using techniques he has honed over decades of celebrity portraiture, and marking his first foray into the world of fine arts, Rolston has captured the inherent humanity of a rarely-seen collection of unique entertainment figures: ventriloquist dummies. Unearthed from the intimate and obscure Vent Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, Rolston used a rigorously formal photographic approach to bring out the power in the faces of these figures through a series of 100 portraits, or "headshots".<br><br>Rolston painstakingly selected the faces he was most drawn to and, in particular, those that conveyed a sense of character through pronounced aging, exaggerated features, and ornately painted faces, drawing the eye directly to the sometimes disturbingly human quality of each dummy. Breathing new life into these inanimate figures, Rolston's photographs channel a sustained and energetic presence that is at once commanding, totemic, and touchingly familiar.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><br></p><p>Well known for his influential lighting techniques and unique approach to art direction and design, photographer and director Matthew Rolston has been strongly identified throughout his career with the revival and modern expression of Hollywood glamour. Rolston was discovered by Andy Warhol for Warhol's groundbreaking <i>Interview Magazine</i>, where he began a successful career in photography. Soon after he began shooting covers and unique editorial assignments for founding editor Jann Wenner of <i>Rolling Stone</i>. Shortly, other prominent publications began to recognize Rolston's work, such as <i>Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Vanity Fair, W, GQ, Esquire, O, the Oprah Magazine </i>and <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>. Deciding to extend his vision beyond still photography into the moving image, Rolston began conceiving, writing and directing music videos and television commercials for such diverse clients as Madonna, Janet Jackson, Christina Aguilera, Beyonc� Knowles, L'Oreal, Revlon, Este� Lauder, Clairol, Pantene, Elizabeth Arden, Gap, and Polo Ralph Lauren, among many others. Once again redefining and expanding the scope of his vision, Rolston has now begun to move into the areas of fine arts, experiential design (including hospitality), product design, and new media ventures.The lush photography book turns Rolston's camera lens on a collection of dummies unearthed at the Vent Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. Matthew Rolston, who typically photographs celebrities and music stars like: Jessica Simpson, Zac Efron, Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige, Adam Levine, Oprah, Kelly Osbourne and Michael Jackson, employed a formal portrait approach to capturing the dolls characterizations in more than 100 images over 224 pages.

Bennett, a brilliant and ambitious Englishman, was deeply influenced by the powerful ideas and practices of G. Gurdjieff. For most of his life, Bennett sought to develop these ideas further and to communicate them to others who were serious about questioning the meaning of their existence. This book was 1954, and while post-World War II Europe was recovering and hopeful, groups that had sprung up around Gurdjieff in the late 1940s were succumbing to sectarianism just five years after the death of their teacher.

The august company in which <i>The Atlantic </i>put Frazier gives an idea of where on the literary spectrum his humorous pieces lie. Frazier&#x2019;s work is funny and elegant and poetic and of the highest literary aspiration, all at the same time. More serious than a &#x201c;gag&#x201d; writer, funnier than most essayists of equal accomplishment, Frazier is of a classical originality.

The much-quoted title piece, originally published in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, gives voice to every parent's battle with table manners, bath time and various laws, statutes and ordinances concerning biting (don't), sand (not edible) and pets (not to be taped). Equally entertaining are Frazier's self-declared role as spokesman for crows, complete with slogan (Crows: We Want to Be Your Only Bird�&#x201e;�) and his mock expos� on the truth behind history's most famous phrases. Caesar's I came, I saw, I conquered is, according to Frazier, simply an early example of mankind's obsession with the sound bite, a snappier version of: I came, I saw, I conquered, I had a snack, I took a bath, and I went to bed, because I was exhausted. A treat for Frazier fanatics and new readers alike, this compilation from the past 13 years has nary a misstep and begs to be read in one sitting. Researchers, Frazier says, have determined that life is too hard. But it's easier with Frazier at the helm. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Spencer Chapman survived for years in the jungle as a guerilla fighter. The Jungle is Neutral is his amazing tale of survival and valor against all odds.<br>As he traveled by bicycle, motorcycle, dugout, on foot, or on his belly through the jungle muck, Chapman recruited sympathetic Chinese, Malays, Tamils, and Sakai tribesman into an irregular corps of jungle fighters. Their mission: to harass the Japanese in any way possible. In riveting scenes, Chapman recalls their daring raids as they blew up bridges, cut communication lines, and affixed plasticine to troop-filled trucks idling by the road. They threw grenades and disappeared into the jungle, their faces darkened with carbon, their tommy guns wrapped in tape so as not to reflect the moonlight. When Chapman wasn't battling the Japanese or escaping from their prisons, he found himself fighting the jungle's incessant rain, wild tigers, unfriendly tribesmen, leeches, disease, and malnutrition.<br>This classic tale has been compared to Lawrence of Arabia's classic account, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, and the gritty account of day-to-day operations is so accurate that the French Foreign Legion used the book as a primer on jungle warfare.

Lord interviewed scores of <i>Titanic</i> passengers, fashioning a gripping you-are-there account of the ship's sinking that you can read in half the time it takes to see the film. The book boasts many perfect movie moments not found in Cameron's film. When the ship hits the berg, passengers see "tiny splinters of ice in the air, fine as dust, that give off myriads of bright colors whenever caught in the glow of the deck lights." Survivors saw dawn reflected off other icebergs in a rainbow of shades, depending on their angle toward the sun: pink, mauve, white, deep blue--a landscape so eerie, a little boy tells his mom, "Oh, Muddie, look at the beautiful North Pole with no Santa Claus on it." <p> A <i>Titanic</i> funnel falls, almost hitting a lifeboat--and consequently washing it 30 yards away from the wreck, saving all lives aboard. One man calmly rides the vertical boat down as it sinks, steps into the sea, and doesn't even get his head wet while waiting to be successfully rescued. On one side of the boat, almost no males are permitted in the lifeboats; on the other, even a male Pekingese dog gets a seat. Lord includes a crucial, tragically ironic drama Cameron couldn't fit into the film: the failure of the nearby ship <i>Californian</i> to save all those aboard the sinking vessel because distress lights were misread as random flickering and the telegraph was an early wind-up model that no one wound. </p><p> Lord's account is also smarter about the horrifying class structure of the disaster, which Cameron reduces to hollow Hollywood formula. No children died in the First and Second Class decks; 53 out of 76 children in steerage died. According to the press, which regarded the lower-class passengers as a small loss to society, "The night was a magnificent confirmation of women and children first, yet somehow the loss rate was higher for Third Class children than First Class men." As the ship sank, writes Lord, "the poop deck, normally Third Class space ... was suddenly becoming attractive to all kinds of people." Lord's logic is as cold as the Atlantic, and his bitter wit is quite dry.</p>"Devotion, gallantry...Benjamin Guggenheim changing to evening clothes to meet death; Mrs. Isador Straus clinging to her husband, refusing to get in a lifeboat; Arthur Ryerson giving his life belt to his wife's maid...It is a book to remember."<br><i>--Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>Adam and Eve and the City: Selected Nonfiction</h2><p>A collection of the author&#39;s most important nonfiction work, includes major pieces on Klaus Barbie, the infamous Nazi Commandant of Lyon; a nonfiction novella on Hawaii; and writings on contemporary American religious movements, women writers and doers</p><p>Starting with an article about Philip Berrigan pouring blood on draft files in 1967 and ending with a background piece on the 1987 trial of Klaus Barbie, critically acclaimed novelist Gray (Lovers and Tyrants and October Blood brings together 20 of her essays that originally appeared in the New York Review of Books, the New Yorker and elsewhere. Under "Politics and Salvation" she gathers meditations on the anti-Vietnam War movement, Nixon's second inaugural celebration, Harvey Cox's "spiritual gyrations," Thomas Merton's life and thought, Rennie Davis and the Perfect Master Maharaj Ji, and the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon. Under "Homelands" she groups her reactions to Teddy Kollek's Jerusalem, a safari in Kenya and Tanzania, the secession movement in Hawaii's "sugar-coated fortress," and a gathering of her family in France. "Women's Lives" contains her impressions of writings by Margaret Atwood, Jane Bowles and Madame de Sevigne. She reviews Wilfrid Sheed's biography of Clare Boothe Luce and the career of Coco Chanel, that "hard-core collaborationist," and recalls life at Black Mountain College under poet Charles Olson. There are also chapters of Gray's "ongoing dialogue with Him/She/It Out There," a dialogue fittingly now given more permanent form here. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gray's impeccable style and fine critical eye are shown to their best advantage in this eclectic but even collection of prose pieces. A novelist as well as an essayist who fixes her thoughtfully reflexive vision on a variety of subjects, Gray transposes generic conventions to produce a topically familiar yet astonishingly revelatory cultural chronicle. Recording recent American political history and journeys to Kenya, Hawaii, and Jerusalem; examining the life and work of such diverse personalities as Margaret Atwood, Clare Boothe Luce, and Madame de Sevigne; and exploring her own history as a child of a member of the French Resistance, Gray remains committed to representing the dispossessed. A politically cogent and highly readable cultural document.

These most resistant Native people, referred to as &#x201c;trouble causers,&#x201d; arrived to curious, boisterous crowds eager to see the Indian warriors they knew only from imagination. <i>Fort Marion Prisoners and the Trauma of Native Education</i> is an evocative work of creative nonfiction, weaving together history, oral traditions, and personal experience to tell the story of these Indian prisoners.<br></p><p>Resurrecting the voices and experiences of the prisoners who underwent a painful regimen of assimilation, Diane Glancy&#x2019;s work is part history, part documentation of personal accounts, and a search for imaginative openings into the lives of the prisoners who left few of their own records other than carvings in their cellblocks and the famous ledger books. They learned English, mathematics, geography, civics, and penmanship with the knowledge that acquiring the same education as those in the U.S.&nbsp;government would be their best tool for petitioning for freedom. Glancy reveals stories of survival and an intimate understanding of the Fort Marion prisoners&#x2019; predicament.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Diane Glancy is an emerita professor of English at Macalester College and is currently a professor at Azusa Pacific University in California.

The craft, creativity, and imagination with which she renders this amazing text powerfully draw the reader into the world of the Fort Marion prisoners. Few texts to date have portrayed their experiences with the upheavals of a changing world with such intimacy and humanism."&#x2014;Steven Williams, <i>American Studies</i> (Steven Williams <i>American Studies</i>)<br><br>"A memorable book. Intuitively and perceptively connecting the difficult journeys of late nineteenth-century Southern Plains Indians and her own difficult journeys more than one hundred years later, Glancy gives us valuable, evocative ways of imagining the Great Plains and its peoples in motion, undertaking often painful and traumatic journeys to understand who they are, where they have been, and where they might be going."&#x2014;Eric Gary Anderson, <i>Great Plains Quarterly</i> (Eric Gary Anderson <i>Great Plains Quarterly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Diane Glancy inhabits a world of images that breathe life and voice for the voiceless men, women, and children. . . . No simple history lesson, this, as Glancy examines how language is both captor and savior, another means of imprisonment and also liberation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Gina Ochsner, author of <i>The Necessary Grace to Fall</i> (Gina Ochsner 2014-02-27)<br><br><p>&#x201c;This book is mesmerizing and will stay with you for lifetimes.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jackie Old Coyote, Apsaalooke Nation, former director of education and outreach at the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development</p><p><br>&nbsp; (Jackie Old Coyote 2014-02-27)<br><br></p>&#x201c;The survival of Indian people represents one of the most important subjects in American history. Glancy creates a multilayered narrative about the Kiowa, Cheyenne, Comanche, and Arapaho Indians, who became prisoners of the United States government during the late nineteenth century.

As a child, Maggie rode and slept in a horse-drawn wagon, picked hops and flowers, and sat beside her father's campfire on ancient verges, poor but free to roam. As the twentieth century progressed, common land was fenced off and the traditional ways disappeared.

From the moment the author, then a young woman from Harvard, first encountered President Johnson at a White House dance in the spring of 1967, she became fascinated by the man--his character, his enormous energy and drive, and his manner of wielding these gifts in an endless pursuit of power. As a member of his White House staff, she soon became his personal confidante, and in the years before his death he revealed himself to her as he did to no other. Widely praised and enormously popular, Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream is a work of biography like few others. With uncanny insight and a richly engrossing style, the author renders LBJ in all his vibrant, conflicted humanity.</p><p><b>Doris Kearns Goodwin</b>, the celebrated historian who is also the author of <i>The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys</i> and other bestsellers, has written a new foreword for this edition of<i> Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream</i>.

Storylines include that of a woman who discovers grisly horror on a mountain road, a plastic love doll who becomes liberated, and a baby&#39;s diaper that is possessed by aliens.</p><p>The recent acclaim garnered by cult hero Lansdale's suspense novels <i>Mucho Mojo</i> and <i>Savage Season</i> (1990) may have readers searching for his award-winning horror stories. This latest collection both horrifies and amuses, sometimes within the same piece. Take, for example, "Steppin' Out, Summer '68," in which three teenage boys set out in search of sex and end up . . . as two boys. In "Love Doll," a man buys one of those inflatable sex dolls, nurtures her, educates her, and is finally left behind. Another highlight is "Godzilla's Twelve Step Program," in which that well-known reptile valiantly takes it one day at a time in his struggle to overcome an addiction to burnin' and stompin'. There's also a nonfiction article chronicling Lansdale's affinity for low-budget horror movies and a very scary play based on an early Lansdale short story. For those who want to risk never sleeping soundly again, there's "Drive-in Date," in which the horror gradually dawns on the appalled reader. On the basis of this collection, Lansdale's newly acquired cult status stands only to be strengthened. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>Bizenghast: Falling Into Fear</h2><p>Bring home more of Bizenghast's gothic beauty!

Before its collapse in the 1920s, the League counted over 250,000 paying members, spread to thirteen states and two Canadian provinces, controlled North Dakota&#x2019;s state government, and birthed new farmer-labor alliances. Yet today it is all but forgotten, neglected even by scholars.<br> <br> Michael J. Lansing aims to change that. <i>Insurgent Democracy</i> offers a new look at the Nonpartisan League and a new way to understand its rise and fall in the United States and Canada. Lansing argues that, rather than a spasm of populist rage that inevitably burned itself out, the story of the League is in fact an instructive example of how popular movements can create lasting change. Depicting the League as a transnational response to economic inequity, Lansing not only resurrects its story of citizen activism, but also allows us to see its potential to inform contemporary movements.</p></p><p><b>Michael J.

This book will be one of the most important rural, western, and American political histories to emerge for some time.&nbsp; At the same time, the book helps to redeem&#x2014;in a proud but not uncritical manner&#x2014;our nation&#x2019;s rich legacy of agrarian radicalism.&#x201d; (<i>Robert D.

Yet, their democratic experiments and their pursuit of alternative economic models offer invaluable insights. Lansing tells their remarkable story with the care and passion that it deserves.&#x201d; (<i>Charles Postel, author of The Populist Vision</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lansing takes us back to a time when ordinary people fought to participate fully in democratic institutions and believed adamantly in a marketplace that would serve all people. They were engaged, imaginative, and courageous.&nbsp;Lansing also reminds us that it is not too late to demand the same.&#x201d; (<i>Catherine McNicol Stock, author of Rural Radicals: Righteous Indignation in the American Grain</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The history of agricultural radicalism in the US (or even the political history of farmers, for that matter) usually ends with the demise of the Populists in the 1890s.&nbsp;Lansing, however, provides a much-needed corrective in this book charting the history of the eponymous North Dakota-born farmers&#x2019; organization, formed in 1915, that spread across agricultural states from Wisconsin to Washington, and even into Canada. . . . This book should be in every academic library collection. Highly recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The book is an excellent opportunity to take a new look at the impact of the Nonpartisan League not only in North Dakota, but nationally and in Canada. Lansing&#x2019;s account of the League&#x2019;s success and failure is also a study of the difficult but not impossible path of citizen action that can transform the political process, even from within the system.&#x201d; (<i>North Dakota History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Written at a time when populisms of the right have decimated that liberalism, Lansing&#x2019;s story invites fresh conversations about the current state of American politics.&#x201d; (<i>Western Historical Quarterly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lansing has produced a well-researched and elegantly written chronicle of the NPL and its short-lived period of operation (1915&#x2013;1923), focusing his keen gaze on how the organization created a rural insurgency dedicated to the proposition of participatory democracy. Aiming his lens at contemporary American politics with its ideological divisions, rapacious capitalism, and growing economic inequality, Lansing&#x2019;s book also serves as a platform for how such a politics might be achieved again.&#x201d; (<i>Agricultural History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lansing&#x2019;s <i>Insurgent Democracy </i>is a product of different times and of recent de�velopments in historical scholarship. Impres�sively researched, it ranges over a full catalog of concepts and issues of current academic inter�est, including transnationalism, women&#x2019;s ac�tivism, historical memory, the radical middle class, movement culture, election laws, par�ticipatory democracy, citizen empowerment, and moral economy. . . . It provides important new perspectives on a remarkable movement and should stimulate further work.&#x201d; (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Meticulously researched, accurate and workmanlike, insightful, and smoothly written. For anyone wishing to learn about a little known chapter in early twentieth-century North American agrarian politics, this book is very good.&#x201d; (<i>Labour/Le Travail</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The strength of <i>Insurgent Democracy</i> comes from Lansing&#x2019;s impressive use of primary sources to bring the NPL&#x2019;s story back to life. His ability to connect American and Canadian history adds a dimension rarely achieved in other works. <i>Insurgent Democracy</i>&#x2019;s thoughtful discussion helps restore the broader political imaginary of the NPL&#x2019;s vision.&#x201d; (<i>Nebraska History</i>)</p><h2>Bristol F2 Fighter Aces of World War I (Aircraft of the Aces)</h2><p>This is the history of the best Allied fighter-destroyer of World War 1 and the pilots who flew it. Nicknamed &#34;Biff&#34; by the pilots, the Bristol F2 Fighter enjoyed extraordinary success over the Western Front in the final 18 months of the war. However, it had an inauspicious debut, as an entire flight of F2As was wiped out by von Richthofen&#39;s Jasta 11. A new improved F2B was soon delivered to the front which functioned in an entirely different manner. The crews operated the plane not as a standard two-seater, but as a single-seat with a &#34;sting in the tail&#34; in the form of a rear gunner with a Lewis machine gun. Numerous ace teams earned the &#34;Biff&#34; grudging respect from its German opponents. This book charts the development of the plane from its unpromising beginnings to the revised model operating with a new kind of tactics. Moreover, the numerous first-hand accounts and combat reports give a fascinating insight into the experiences of the pilots themselves.</p><p>A resident of Leesburg, Virginia, Jon Guttman is senior editor, research director, and contributing writer for Primedia Enthusiast Publications.

(General Fiction).</p><p>Richard Paul Evans originally wrote <i>The Christmas Box</i> as an expression of love for his two daughters, never intending for it to be published. Many Christmas seasons (and a rich publishing contract) later, this touching tale relates the meaning of Christmas in a profound but simple way. Rick, Keri, and their 4-year-old daughter, Jenna, are hired as caretakers and are welcomed into the home of Mary, an ailing widow, just in time for the holidays. Before long, it becomes apparent that Mary cherishes their companionship, and this young family begins to understand that their relationship to Mary is more special than any one of them could have realized. These tender relationships, fraught with real-life struggles, are the backdrop for unraveling a mysterious secret that gently propels the reader through this short story. Unlike most generic Christmas stories, Evans manages to bypass triviality, imbedding these pages with humble truth and emotion. This tiny treasure will cause you to rejoice in the blessings of the season while stirring up a childlike vigor as old profundity is revealed anew. In a season often shrouded in selfishness and materialism, Evans reminds the reader that the only way that we can genuinely love one another is by accepting the greatest gift of love ever given--that of a Father who "so loved His children that He sent His son, that we might someday return to Him." <i>--Jill Heatherly</i><b>The Christmas Box</b> <p> "Whatever the reason, I find that with each passing Christmas the story of the christmas box is told less and needed more. So I record it now for all future generations to accept or dismiss, as seems them good. As for me, I believe. And it is, after all, my story." </p><p> So begins <i>The Christmas Box</i>, the touching story of a widow and the young family who moves in with her. Together they discover the first gift of Christmas and learn what Christmas is really all about. <i>The Christmas Box</i> is a Christmas story unlike any other.</p></p><h2>Draupnir&#39;s Sweat and Mardoll&#39;s Tears: An Archaeology of Jewellery, Gender and Identity in Viking Age Iceland (BAR International)</h2><p>Items of jewellery in Icelandic society traditionally have been analysed in typological, chronological and technological terms with descriptive approaches to discussing their presence in the archaeological record. Drawing on this research but taking a more anthropological approach, Mich�le Hayeur Smith looks at jewellery as social symbols and a potential indicator of gender, status and power differences, and of spiritual and religious sentiment. Taking evidence largely from burial contexts dating to between AD 870 and 1000, the results of her study suggest that jewellery was used to differentiate between the sexes, and especially to draw attention to female sexual attributes, and most likely to denote differences in gender and cultural identity. The materials used to produce jewellery, craftsmanship, technology and production are also examined in the later chapters.</p><p></p><h2>History of Magic and Experimental Science, Vol 1</h2><p>This is a new release of the original 1923 edition.</p><p></p><h2>Landscaping Earth Ponds: The Complete Guide</h2><p>The guru of earth ponds explains how to site, design, shape, and plant these beloved fixtures of rural landscapes--and make them fit your property and your life.

Confronted by the eccentricities of these island people (the English husband who never turned on the lights, the legislators who behaved like drunken frat boys, the hedgehog lovers), she set about trying to figure out the British. Part anthropological field study and part memoir, <em>The Anglo Files</em> has already received great acclaim and recognition for the astuteness, humor, and sensitivity with which the author wields her pen.</p><p>Sarah Lyall a writer-at-large for the New York Times, lived in London until 2013, when she moved back home to New York. She&#x2019;s still adjusting.When New York native Sarah Lyall relocated to England to work for the London branch of the NEW YORK TIMES, she found herself inspired to report beyond what her position required. Veteran audiobook narrator Cassandra Campbell recounts the entertaining story of the author&#39;s transition to her new country, and her study of its history and people. Lending expressive American and British accents to Lyall&#39;s masterful grasp of language and insightful humor, Campbell gives unique identities to the myriad of ordinary and unique characters Lyall encounters as she traverses the isle&#39;s physical and social geography. Campbell&#39;s performance impressively complements the author&#39;s occasionally verbose assembly of posts--both quirky and poignant--as she explores what it truly means to be British.

Heading for her quarters, Zephyrette Jill McLeod walks through the Silver Gorge Pullman car, and sees something she can't explain. Is the shimmering light a ghost? Jill doubts the evidence of her own eyes, but soon learns that others have seen the phenomenon, too. Whatever-whoever-is haunting roomette four may be connected to an incident two months earlier, when Jill found the body of a young man there. The verdict on the death was natural causes. Now it looks like the unquiet spirit is pointing to murder.<br><br>Several years ago Dawson took a trip on the Pacific Sands, a privately owned Pullman car. The owner told stories about a roomette on the car that was supposedly haunted. Passengers would tell about hearing voices during the night, and the porters who worked trips talked about the porter call button in the roomette ringing. When the porter answered the bell, no one was there. As a mystery writer, anything and everything was grist for the mill. As a matter of fact, the roomette on the Pacific Sands was number four.</p><p>This is Janet Dawson&#39;s third mystery in the California Zephyr series.

She took another step. The light flickered and moved into roomette four. <br><br>She shook herself. A few more steps, then she stopped at the open doorway of the roomette and peered inside.

Whether we view it in religious, social, or political terms, Christianity has deeply and integrally influenced the Western worldview and way of life. Yet, throughout Christian history, compelling controversies have existed surrounding the faith&#39;s first three centuries, when it grew from a persecuted sect into a powerful religion. These controversies bring into question many commonly accepted beliefs about Christianity. In this course, an award-winning professor and New York Times best-selling author offers a penetrating investigation of the 24 most pivotal controversies, shedding light on fallacies that obscure an accurate view of the religion and how it evolved into what it is today. In each lecture, you&#39;ll delve into a key issue in Christianity&#39;s early development: Did the Jews Kill Jesus? Was Jesus Raised from the Dead? Did the Disciples Write the Gospels? Did Early Christians Accept the Trinity? Is the Book of Revelation about Our Future? Who Chose the Books of the New Testament? You&#39;ll delve into the conception of the meshiach (messiah) in Jewish tradition, and the basis for the core Christian claim that a suffering messiah was predicted in the Jewish scriptures. In grasping Paul&#39;s role in the early faith, you contemplate the key differences between the teachings of Jesus himself and the Christian view of his death and resurrection. And you trace the ambiguous role in early Christianity of the Jewish scriptures, and how these books came to be accepted as the Christian Old Testament. Explore these and other intriguing questions in this unique inquiry into the core of Christian tradition.</p><p></p><h2>Sculptural Metal Clay Jewelry: Techniques and Explorations</h2><p><p>Beginning with an overview of the properties of metal clay, including safety information and metalsmithing terms, this thorough resource offers detailed procedures for creating a variety of components, settings, findings, attachments, 3-D forms, and textured effects.

Writers as varied as Ballard, Borges, Conrad, and Freud have been mesmerized by forms of human extremity&#x2015;experiences that are on the outer edge of the possible or that tip into fantasy and myth. What happens to us when we starve, when we fight, when we are imprisoned? And how do our imaginations leap into worlds way beyond our real experiences?</p><p><i>The Silence of Animals</i> is consistently fascinating, filled with unforgettable images and a delight in the conundrum of human existence&#x2015;an existence that we decorate with countless myths and ideas, where we twist and turn to avoid acknowledging that we too are animals, separated from the others perhaps only by our self-conceit. In the Babel we have created for ourselves, it is the silence of animals that both reproaches and bewitches us.</p></p><p><p><b>John Gray </b>is the author of many critically acclaimed books, including <i>The Immortalization Commission</i>,<i> Black Mass</i>, and <i>Straw Dogs</i>. A regular contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, he is Emeritus Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics.</p><p>&#x201c;Gray's godless mysticism asks us to look outside ourselves and simply see. This is a lot more difficult than it sounds . . . Sometimes I think John Gray is the great Schopenhauerian European Buddhist of our age. What he offers is a gloriously pessimistic cultural analysis, which rightly reduces to rubble the false idols of the cave of liberal humanism.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Simon Critchley, The Los Angeles Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Gray's is] a powerful message, and not without elements of profundity. And it is conveyed with eloquence of language and dignity of thought.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert W. Merry, The National Interest</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gray's fans should find much here to please them. The range of literary, historical and philosophical extracts--from Conrad and Zweig to Borges and John Ashbery, and from Nietzsche and Freud to Robinson Jeffers and Czeslaw Milosz, to name only a few--is broad and deep. Gray's own utterances are by turns characteristically dark, audacious and outrageous.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Caspar Henderson, The Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Silence of Animals</i> is a beautifully written book, the product of a strongly questioning mind. It is effectively an anthology with detailed commentary, setting out one rich and suggestive episode after another, each of which becomes only more suggestive by the juxtaposition.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Philip Hensher, The Spectator</i></p></p><h2>The Ghost Writer</h2><p>A young writer in search of a spiritual father, Nathan Zuckerman views E. I. Lonoff, who lives with his wife and his student-mistress in rural Massachusetts, as an embodiment of the ideal of artistic integrity and independence</p><p>A middle-aged writer recalls his younger self. At 23, Nathan Zuckerman has had four stories published and a small, flattering <i>Saturday Review</i> up-and-coming-author profile (complete with a photo of him playing with his ex-girlfriend's cat), which he purports to scorn. As genuine and polite as he seems, Zuckerman has already hurt his family with his autobiographical art and ruined his relationship with adultery and honesty. Visiting his reclusive idol (famed for his "blend of sympathy and pitilessness") in the Berkshires, the writer watches himself watching himself and attempts to confront his work and life. Instead he finds himself turning reality into metafiction. A quote he happens upon from Henry James only complicates matters further: "We work in the dark--we do what we can--we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art." Events, however, have their revenge, weaving more out of control than even he can anticipate or ask for. Philip Roth is the master of the uncomfortable, and his alter ego a connoisseur of self-involvement, self-loathing, and self-examination. ("Virtuous reader, if you think that after intercourse all animals are sad, try masturbating on the daybed in E. I. Lonoff's study and see how you feel when it's over.")The Ghost Writer introduces Nathan Zuckerman in the 1950s, a budding writer infatuated with the Great Books, discovering the contradictory claims of literature and experience while an overnight guest in the secluded New England farmhouse of his idol, E. I. Lonoff. <br>At Lonoff's, Zuckerman meets Amy Bellette, a haunting young woman of indeterminate foreign background who turns out to be a former student of Lonoff's and who may also have been his mistress. Zuckerman, with his active, youthful imagination, wonders if she could be the paradigmatic victim of Nazi persecution. If she were, it might change his life. <br>The first volume of the trilogy and epilogue "Zuckerman Bound, The Ghost Writer is about the tensions between literature and life, artistic truthfulness and conventional decency--and about those implacable practitioners who live with the consequences of sacrificing one for the other.</p><h2>Rusty Nail: A Jacqueline &#34;Jack&#34; Daniels Mystery (Jack Daniels Mysteries)</h2><p><strong>Lee Child, David Morrell, and M.J.

The first chapters discuss Europe's various attitudes toward its Jewry and the frequent heating up and spilling over of prejudice, leading to persecution and violence and forced conversions. The book goes on to demonstrate how the Inquisition was rekindled in Spain during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, and how a fearful populace contributed to tyranny over and betrayal of not only Jews and marranos (converts), but of virtually anyone who aroused the suspicion of the inquisitors. It discusses the Catholic monarchs' conflicts with the Pope, and Torquemada's rise to power. All manner of torture and the punishments an accused person might be subjected to are described in graphic detail.

Journalist Joe Oakes is a born skeptic who makes his living exposing supernatural hoaxes. But his stay with a cult-like religious group on Scotland?s remote Pig Island might be enough to turn him into a believer. When the island erupts into bloodshed, Oakes must abandon everything he thought he knew to discover the secret behind exiled cult leader Malachi Dove, who lives alone behind a wall of electricity and toxic waste on the island?s far end. As the cataclysm of violence crashes down around him, Oakes is ultimately forced to confront the very nature of evil itself.<br><br></p><p><p>Mo Hayder has worked as a barmaid, security guard, filmmaker, hostess in a Tokyo nightclub, and teacher of English as a foreign language. She is the author of <b>The Birdman</b> and <b>The Treatment</b>.</p>"Hayder skillfully melds an atmosphere of fear and a gripping sense of place in this thriller set on a remote Scottish island owned by Psychogenic Healing Ministries, whose followers the locals believe to be Satanists. A humanoid creature with a long tail has been captured on video, and repeated analysis reveals no hint of technological fraud. But world-weary, thirtysomething hoax buster Joe Oakes is on the case. His history with PHM's former leader, Malachi Dove, spans two decades. Oakes blames faith-healer Dove for his aunt's horrendous death and for duping him into believing he had a deadly tumor. He published an expose, and Dove's threatened retaliatory lawsuit fizzled because the healer was presumed dead. Years later, Oakes finally lands an invitation to Pig Island, home of 30 PHM cultists. It's rather a paradise, except for the occasional smell of putrefying flesh. To Oakes' amazement, isolated on the other side of the island behind a row of pig skulls is none other than Malachi Dove.

[Pig Island] masterfully exposes not only the horror but also the human frailty at the story&#x2019;s core (Anna Mundow,&nbsp;The Boston Globe)<br><br>"At the start of Hayder's profoundly creepy and creepily convincing thriller, hard-bitten journalist Joe Oakes arrives on the west coast of Scotland to visit a reclusive cult on remote Pig Island. Oakes hopes to investigate a supposed half-animal, half-human creature distantly glimpsed in a tourist's film and settle his long-held grudge against the cult's founder, charismatic crackpot Malachi Dove, who has long since withdrawn to his barricaded compound on Pig Island. In the ensuing mayhem, Oakes wins the confidence of Dove's mysterious daughter and learns the hard way that the investigative skills on which he prides himself are flimsy at best. Though gruesome enough to satisfy even the most hardcore horror fan, this rigorously imagined novel is also full of apt (if bleak) detail and graced with a perfect plot twist at story's end. Hayder (The Devil of Nanking) offers both a riveting story and a nuanced, distinctly modern look at secrecy and publicity, belief and skepticism, normal and taboo, (in)sight and blindness.

But not for long. If Molly has her way!</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No BioThirteen-year-old Molly Gerry and her older sister Colleen&#x2019;s world is rocked when their father dies, leaving them penniless. Their best hope seems to be leaving their small Illinois town to work at a Harvey Eating House in Raton, New Mexico. Molly manages to appear 18 (the minimum Harvey Girl age) in order to get the job and soon catches on to the rhythm of life beside the railroad tracks. She continues to struggle with the desire to return home and worries about the fact that the outlaw Genius Jim is still on the loose. Inspired by the author&#x2019;s great-grandmother&#x2019;s experiences, this historical bildungsroman shows life out west in the late 1800s in all its flash and grittiness. Molly is a solidly drawn character, attracted more to cooking than serving and determined to be honest and fair in her work. The outlaws provide spice, and the romance Molly tries to conjure up for Colleen gives humor. The values of education, courage, and simplicity all come together in this delightful tale.

The challenge here is to find the animal in each of 20 famous paintings, which are beautifully reproduced in full color on glossy white pages. Some creatures are clearly visible, while others-such as the embroidered snake on the sleeve of Queen Elizabeth I's gown and the baby monkey in an Indian miniature-provide a challenge. The pictures are randomly arranged-a Titian appears before a Fernand Leger, a Peter Blume before a Lucas Cranach. The juxtapositions are startling as the pages are turned, but each work is interesting and begs to be lingered over and discussed.

These selections present an engrossing portrait of Wesley during the course of his travels and evangelistic activities, illuminating the preacher&#x2019;s views and opinions on a host of contemporary matters. Begun as a public vindication of his early spiritual and pastoral work in Oxford and America, Wesley&#x2019;s journal became a means of keeping far-flung outposts of Methodism in touch with one another, a device for administering encouragement and rebukes, and a textbook of the experiential religion Wesley spent his life proclaiming. Wesley&#x2019;s eclectic interests and passion for rational analysis also make his journal a rich source for any reader interested in observing the conditions and values of society&#x2014;particularly those of the lower classes&#x2014;through the eyes of a well-educated and intelligent gentleman of the time.</p></p><p><b>HENDRICKSON CLASSIC BIOGRAPHIES</b><br> Hendrickson Classic Biographies feature enduring stories about real people whose lives have been touched and transformed by God, and who in turn have touched others with God's love.

Methodism had three rises, the first at Oxford University with the founding of the so-called &#x201c;Holy Club,&#x201d; the second while Wesley was parish priest in Savannah, Georgia, and the third in London after Wesley&#x2019;s return to England. The movement took form from its third rise in the early 1740s when Wesley, along with others, began itinerant field preaching and the subsequently founded religious societies for the formation of believers. This was the first widely successful evangelical movement in Britain. Wesley&#x2019;s Methodist Connexion included societies throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland before spreading to other parts of the English-speaking world and beyond. He divided his religious societies further into classes and bands for intensive accountability and religious instruction.</p></p><h2>Art &amp; Sole: Contemporary Sneaker Art &amp; Design</h2><p>In recent years the sneaker scene has exploded with limited editions and artist/designer collaborations.

Famed for his ebullient personality and garish red glasses, he has become a well-recognised figure in the world of gardening.<p> The Botanical Garden Volume I: Trees and Shrubs<br> <b>Introduction</b> </p><p> Our aim in this book is to provide new information and a new way of looking at plants and gardening from a more botanical viewpoint. The plant families are covered systematically, and the relationships between them are discussed; readers will be able to put the knowledge they have acquired piecemeal into a framework, and understand the botanical groups and the similarities and differences between them. </p><p> <b>Genera and plant evolution</b> </p><p> This book is based on the genus, genera in the plural, the Latin word for family, class, or race. Plants are classified in a hierarchy of many ranks, but the only three commonly used are family, genus, and species. To take an example, the black or water birch <i>Betula nigra</i> is a species in the genus <i>Betula</i> and the family <i>Betulaceae</i>. A genus is usually a very natural and familiar grouping, such as oak, beech, day-lily, or dahlia. Many genera are small and easily recognised by a combination of characteristics not found in another group of plants, for instance the green flowers, lobed leaves, and dry, winged seeds of <i>Liriodendron</i>, the tulip tree. Other genera are large, with tens or even hundreds of species, and can be further divided into subgenera; some botanists may consider these subgenera worthy of division into distinct genera, for example the division of <i>Cornus</i> into <i>Benthamidia</i>, <i>Chamaepericlymenum</i>, and <i>Swida</i>. Modern studies sometimes confirm these divisions, or sometimes show them to be artificial. The plant world can be imagined as a huge, chaotic, and multi-stemmed tree, branching repeatedly, with some branches dying, others thriving and waxing or waning in importance through the millenia. Some branches have survived almost unchanged for millions of years, others that were formerly very important have died out. A few have left just one or two remnants as isolated individuals on remote islands, in gorges, or in mountain forests; others have prospered and now exist as thousands of species. </p><p> <b>The classical arrangement</b> </p><p> Botanists are faced with the problem of showing in a list this complex result of millions of years of different lines of evolution. Linnaeus' system was based strictly on the sexual parts of the plant, the number of styles and stamens in each flower. This was convenient and worked quite well, but it was clearly artificial. Botanists soon began to work on more natural systems reflecting the evolutionary ancestry of plants, and ever since have continued the search for more natural groupings. The classical order of families was based on the premise that evolution of flowers was from the simple to the complex; thus magnolia and its relatives, with large, simple flowers, were considered especially primitive; daisies, on the other hand, with many flowers aggregated into a head that looks like a single flower, were considered advanced. </p><p> <b>New developments</b> </p><p> To classify modern plants accurately, we need to know their ancestry. Plant remains fossilize very poorly compared with bones or shells, but we can guess from fossils that trees in the coal-forming forests might have resembled giant clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, and conifers. Our knowledge of early flowering plants, probably appearing in the Jurassic, is even more scanty; it is likely many were aquatic herbs with no woody parts. Fortunately, we now have a new tool, DNA, to give clues to ancient relationships. DNA studies have confirmed the classical outline, but also show the true picture to be more complex. The relationships of several groups of plants that did not fit conveniently into any of the old schemes are now being clarified. Some of the major groupings and new evidence concerning their ordering are outlined on the following pages. Volume I follows broadly the order and relationships proposed by Kubitski and adapted by Mabberley in <i>The Plant Book</i> (1997); in Volume 2, I have been able to take into account more recently published DNA studies and have broadly followed the order proposed by Judd and co-workers in 1999. The monocotyledons are placed at the end in both volumes. </p><p> <b>Tree ferns, ginkgo, and conifers</b> </p><p> The ancient tropical swamp forests, which have ended up as coal today, were dominated by giant clubmosses, seed-ferns, and tree ferns, with primitive conifers. Few remnants of this flora have survived, probably because of the drastic changes in the world climate between the warm, wet Carboniferous and the dry Permian periods. Only some ancestors of <i>Osmunda</i> and relatives of the huge tropical fern <i>Marattia</i> survived from these warm forests; the modern ferns are a result of active evolution and divergence during the Triassic and Jurassic. Most of the tree ferns (see pp.16-17) are found in wet, cool tropical and subtropical forests, and the hardier ones come from the southern hemisphere. <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> (see p.18) is a remarkable survivor, the only one of its family. The leaves of this species and of many other, now extinct, <i>Ginkgo</i> species are found as far back as the Jurassic, and throughout the northern hemisphere in the early Tertiary. A second species, <i>G. adiantoides</i>, survived until the Miocene in North America, and into the Pliocene in Europe. <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> survived somewhere in China, where it was recognised as something special by early Chinese civilisation and widely planted in temple gardens. Other relicts such as the conifers <i>Metasequoia glyptostroboides</i> (see p.38) in China, and <i>Wollemia nobilis</i> in Australia also show how an ancient genus can survive in a small remote area. Conifers are today by far the most important group of ancient woody plants; they are thought to have originated as far back as the Devonian, but most of the present-day families can be traced back only as far as the Jurassic or Triassic. </p><p> <b>Magnolia, bay, and Calycanthus</b> </p><p> This group of families is interesting in having various combinations of primitive characteristics, that is, features that may have been present in the earliest flowering trees to grow on earth. Primitive wood anatomy, aromatic leaves, spirally arranged floral parts, and simple stamens with undifferentiated filaments are characteristics common in the group and thought to be primitive. In <i>Magnolia</i>, <i>Michelia</i>, and <i>Liriodendron</i> (the Magnoliaceae, see pp.56-59), the flowers are large and often showy, with numerous spirally arranged petals, stamens, and ovules. The related family Annonaceae (see p.65) is mainly tropical, and contains the custard apple, <i>Annona</i>, and the North American pawpaw, <i>Asimina triloba</i>. Winteraceae (see pp.60-61) which includes <i>Drimys</i>, is also primitive in many characteristics and probably belongs with the magnolia group. Also related to the Magnollaceae are the small but interesting families Illiclaceae (see p.63) and Schisandraceae (see p.62); <i>Schisandra</i>, with its unusual red, fleshy fruits in hanging chains, and <i>Kadsura</i>, with similar fruits in a round head, are the only genera in the latter. The bay tree family, the Lauraceae (see pp.66-71), contains over 2500 species, mainly in the tropical forests. Most species have small flowers but sometimes large fruit, for example the avocado tree <i>Persea americans</i>. Others are aromatic, including the bay itself, <i>Laurus</i>, and <i>Cinnamomum</i>, the cinnamon. Related to Lauraceae is the Calycanthaceae (see pp.72-73), containing both the chocolate-brown flowered Carolina and California allspice, <i>Calycanthus</i>, and the lovely white-flowered <i>Sinocalycanthus</i>, recently discovered in China. </p><p> <b>Witch hazel and Liquidambar</b> </p><p> The witch hazel family, Hamamelidaceae (see pp.99-109), and the related Cercidiphyllaceae (see p.96) are superficially similar in many characteristics to the catkin-bearing plants such as hazels (Betulaceae, see below and p.119). <i>Hamamelis</i> itself has clusters of strongly scented flowers with ribbon-shaped petals; in <i>Corylopsi</i></p></p><h2>Shadowrun: Where Man Meets Magic and Machine</h2><p>The Year is 2050.

A former technical journalist and industrial editor, she lives in North Surrey, England.<p><b>Chapter One: In the Dark of the Morning</b> </p><p> At half past seven on a January morning, the dawn should have been breaking, but the sky was so overcast that to all intents and purposes, it was still dark and I had half a dozen servants standing about with flambeaux so that our little party could see to mount the horses. </p><p> Malton, the elderly former steward who had been called out of retirement to look after Withysham while the present steward, Roger Brockley, accompanied me on my journey, held one of the torches and another was in the unsteady grasp of ancient Gladys, who was even older than Malton and shouldn't be out in this bitter northeasterly but had insisted all the same. </p><p> Gladys wasn't exactly a servant, more a responsibility. She did what she could about the house and was good at doctoring hurts and fevers and also at milking cows, but I didn't employ her. She had attached herself to me, and Gladys, bless her acid tongue and good heart, was fond of me. </p><p> The chill wind, flowing over the downs of Sussex, carried a threat of snow. The breaths of people and horses alike smoked visibly in the torchlight. Brockley, who was also an experienced groom, had made sure that all the horses had warm saddlecloths, but as I mounted, I could tell by the droop of my gelding's head that he would rather have stayed in his nice snug stall. I sympathized. I too was well clad but my teeth would have chattered if I'd let them. My tirewoman, Fran Dale, already in her saddle, was less restrained than I was, and her teeth really were chattering, audibly. My nine-year-old daughter, Meg, perched on her sturdy pony, was just a small, hunched shape beneath her stout cloak and felt hat, and her nurse, Bridget, waiting on the pillion of Brockley's cob, Speckle, was a weird spectacle because she was a fat woman to start with and her defense against the weather consisted of a vast hooded mantle that Bridget had constructed herself using old blankets, because she said that they were thicker than conventional materials. As a result, Speckle looked as though he had a she-bear on his crupper. </p><p> I settled myself, gathering up my reins and gazing wistfully back at my house. Withysham Abbey was not modern. My home had no white plaster and black timbering, no tall ornamental chimneys or elegant imitation battlements. It had once been an abbey of nuns, until King Henry the Eighth dissolved the monasteries and sold off their buildings and lands, and even now, Withysham's quiet gray stone walls, its low, pointed doorways and slender leaded windows, had an outdated, ecclesiastical air. </p><p> But it was homely, too. The candlelight within the flawed medieval panes spoke of comfort indoors. At this moment, I wished with all my heart that I were back in the friendly shelter of those lit rooms. My earlier willingness for this errand had completely evaporated. I shouldn't be doing this, I thought. I didn't <i>want</i> to do it. The seventeenth of January, with snow in the wind, was no time to start a journey that would take me at least to Northumberland and might even compel me over the border into Scotland. Besides, I was worried about Meg. </p><p> As if she had heard me thinking, Meg edged her pony over to me. "Mother?" </p><p> "We'll be on the move in a moment, darling. I hope you're warm enough." </p><p> "Yes, thank you. Only, I wanted to ask..." </p><p> "Yes, sweetheart?" I said, larding my words with endearments because I was so very anxious about her and so reluctant to face the separation that was now only a day away. </p><p> "Will it be all right? Will the Hendersons let me stay with them?" </p><p> "What makes you think they won't, darling? They've always made you welcome before." </p><p> "I know, but...once or twice, I've heard you talking to Dale and Brockley...I wasn't listening on purpose. I just heard you." </p><p> "Did you, indeed, little Mistress Bigears?" I said, trying to sound amused. </p><p> "Yes. I'm sorry, Mother. But -- will it be all right?" </p><p> "I hope so!" I said. </p><p> Brockley was swinging into his saddle and checking his girth. Dale was muttering dismally that this was terrible, that she never could abide riding long distances and in cold weather like this...! </p><p> "Let be, Fran," said Brockley. I still called my tirewoman Dale because that was her name when she entered my service but since then, she and Brockley had married. Strictly speaking, she was Mistress Brockley now, which was often an advantage because Brockley could sometimes check her habit of complaining, which I rarely managed to do. </p><p> "We're on our way now, and that's that," Brockley said firmly. "You wouldn't want to stay behind and neither the mistress nor I would want that, either. Madam?" </p><p> "Yes, Brockley," I said. "We're on our way." </p><p> And so, calling good-byes to the shivering servants, we started out. As we reached the gates, I glanced back once more and noticed wryly that they had plunged back into the warmth of the house before we had fairly left the premises. The flambeaux were gone. Only the faint glimmer of candlelit windows remained. How long, I wondered, before I would see my home again? </p><p> I should never have agreed to this, but it was too late now. </p><p><br> My family, the Faldenes, had old-fashioned attitudes, and in more ways than one. They clung to the old Catholic religion despite Queen Elizabeth's legislation against it, and their domestic life was similarly behind the times. In modern households, it was now customary for the family to dine in private, separately from their servants. At my family home of Faldene House, where I was brought up, everyone dined together and the great hall was still the center of the household, just as it had been in medieval times. </p><p> It was also still decorated with the swords and pikes of bygone Faldenes who had fought at Agincourt and Cr�cy. According to my mother, when she came home in disgrace from the court of King Henry the Eighth, with child by a court gallant whom she would not name -- presumably because he was married -- her outraged parents and her brother, Herbert, marched her around the hall, pointing at these relics of heroism, and accused her of betraying them. Which was most unfair because many of the family's bygone heroes had had careers that were as lively off the battlefield as on it, and we had plenty of unofficial relatives in Faldene village and beyond it, too, in the neighboring hamlet of Westwater and in the village attached to my present home of Withysham, five miles away. </p><p> I, Ursula Faldene, was the daughter born to my mother after her return home. When my grandparents died, the responsibility for my mother and for me passed to Uncle Herbert and his thin, sour wife, Aunt Tabitha. They discharged it dutifully, I suppose. We weren't turned out to beg for our bread. That much, I admit. </p><p> I was even allowed to share their children's tutor, and thus I did receive an education, though it was a grudging one. What I did not receive, however, except from my mother, was kindness. When I was sixteen, she too died, I think worn-out by life in a constant atmosphere of disapproval. I might well have ended my days as unpaid dogsbody to my aunt and accounts clerk to my uncle (who eventually realized that an educated Ursula could be of more use than an illiterate one), except that I caught the eye of Gerald Blanchard, son of a neighbor. </p><p> Unfortunately, Gerald was betrothed to my well-dowered cousin Mary, daughter of Uncle Herbert and Aunt Tabitha. I suppose it was natural for our respective families to be enraged when we eloped. </p><p> We never regretted it, though. With Gerald, I traveled to Antwerp, where he worked for the queen's financier, Sir Thomas Gresham, and it was Gerald who gave me my dark-haired daughter, Meg. When he died of smallpox, Meg and I came home to England and an uncertain future, because neither the Faldenes nor the Blanchards were willing to help us. Mercifully, we had other friends, including Gresham, who were more generous. Strings were pulled; arrangements were made. Foster parents were found for Meg, and Ursula Blanchard, impoverished widow, became a Lady of the Queen's Presence Chamber, and after a time, married again, this time to a Frenchman, Matthew de la Roche. </p><p> That was a passionate union but a doomed one, for he was Elizabeth's enemy, working against her, which too often drove us apart. Now Matthew too was dead, of a summer plague, and I was widowed once more, but by this time I was well provided for. I was the chatelaine of Withysham, dignified and comfortable, with profitable land attached to it. I had expected to live there, retired from court life and united with my daughter at last, and -- well, yes -- to enjoy the chagrin of Uncle Herbert and Aunt Tabitha at having their despised and baseborn niece as a well-off, well-respected, and extremely well-dressed neighbor. </p><p> What I didn't expect was to be hunted up by a distracted Aunt Tabitha and dragged, not by coercion but by pleading, back to Faldene and put in the position of one who could be their savior, if only I would let bygones be bygones and agree. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Fiona Buckley</p></p><h2>Hornblower and the Atropos #4 in Series</h2><p>Sixth printing March 1980 Cover illustration by Bruce Minney</p><p></p><h2>An Irish Country Doctor</h2><p>Barry Laverty, M.B., can barely find the village of Ballybucklebo on a map when he first sets out to seek gainful employment there, but already he knows that there is nowhere he would rather live than in the emerald hills and dales of Northern Ireland.

Through O�&#x20ac;&#x2122;Reilly Barry soon gets to know all of the village�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s colorful and endearing residents, including:<br> <br>A malingering Major and his equally hypochondriacal wife;<br> <br>An unwed servant girl, who refuses to divulge the father of her upcoming baby;<br> <br>A slightly daft old couple unable to marry for lack of a roof;<br> <br>And a host of other eccentric characters who make every day an education for the inexperienced young doctor.<br> <br>Ballybucklebo is long way from Belfast, and Barry is quick to discover that he still has a lot to learn about the quirks and traditions of country life. But with pluck and compassion and only the slightest touch of blarney, he will find out more about life�&#x20ac;&#x201d;and love�&#x20ac;&#x201d;than he ever imagined back in medical school.<br><i>An Irish Country Doctor</i> is a charming and engrossing tale that will captivate readers from the very first page�&#x20ac;&#x201d;and leave them yearning to visit the Irish countryside of days gone by.</p><p><p>Patrick Taylor, M.D., is the author of the Irish Country books, including <i>An Irish Country Village</i>, <i>An Irish Country Christmas</i>, <i>An Irish Country Girl</i>, and <i>An Irish Country Courtship</i>. Taylor was born and raised in Bangor County Down in Northern Ireland. After qualifying as a specialist in 1969, he worked in Canada for thirty-one years. He now lives on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.</p><p>Author&#x2019;s NoteDoctor Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly and the denizens of Ballybucklebo first appeared in 1995 in my monthly column in Stitches: The Journal of Medical Humour. It was suggested to me that these characters might form the foundation for a novel.I had just finished Pray for Us Sinners, and hesitating to delve once more into the misery of the Ulster Troubles, I found the idea of something lighter to be appealing. An Irish Country Doctor began to take shape.Like Only Wounded and Pray for Us Sinners, the book is set in the northeast corner of Ireland, but unlike its predecessors, which I strove to make historically accurate, this story has taken some liberties with geography and time.The setting is a fictional village, the name of which came from my high-school French teacher who, enraged by my inability to conjugate irregular verbs, yelled, &#x201c;Taylor, you&#x2019;re stupid enough to come from Ballybucklebo.&#x201d; Those of an etymological bent may wish to know what the name means. Bally (Irish, baile) is a townland&#x2014;a mediaeval geographic term encompassing a small village and the surrounding farms, Buachaill means &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; and b� is a cow. In Bailebuchaillb�, or Ballybucklebo&#x2014;the townland of the boy&#x2019;s cow&#x2014;time and place are as skewed as they are in Brigadoon.Little Irish is spoken in the North, but I have been at pains to use the Ulster dialect. It is rich and colourful, but often incomprehensible to one not from that part of the world. For those who may have some difficulty, I have taken the liberty of appending a glossary (page 345).My attention to the spoken idiom is as accurate as I can make it; however, the purist will note that in 1964, the Twelfth of July fell on a Sunday, not a Thursday, and Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s first book of poetry was not published until 1966. No salmon river called the Bucklebo flows through north County Down. The nearest is the Shimna River in the Mourne Mountains. But everything else is as accurate as extensive reading and memory permit.The rural Ulster that I have portrayed has vanished. The farms and villages still look much as they did, but the simplicity of rural life has been banished by the Troubles and the all-pervasive influence of television. The automatic respect for their learning shown to those at the top of the village hierarchy&#x2014;doctor, teacher, minister, and priest&#x2014;is a thing of the past, but men like O&#x2019;Reilly were common when I was a very junior doctor. And on that subject, may I please lay to rest a question I am frequently asked by readers of my column in Stitches? Barry Laverty and Patrick Taylor are not one and the same. Doctor F. F. O&#x2019;Reilly is a figment of my troubled mind, despite the efforts of some of my expatriate Ulster friends to see in him a respected&#x2014;if unorthodox&#x2014;medical practitioner of the time. Lady Macbeth does owe her being to our demoniacally possessed cat, Minnie, and Arthur Guinness owes his to a black Labrador, now long gone but who had an insatiable thirst for Foster&#x2019;s lager. All the other characters are composites, drawn from my imagination and from my experiences as a rural GP.Patrick Taylor1You Can&#x2019;t Get There from HereBarry Laverty&#x2014;Doctor Barry Laverty&#x2014;his houseman&#x2019;s year just finished, ink barely dry on his degree, pulled his beat-up Volkswagen Beetle to the side of the road and peered at a map lying on the passenger seat. Six Road Ends was clearly marked. He stared through the car&#x2019;s insect-splattered windscreen. Judging by the maze of narrow country roads that ran one into the other just up ahead, somewhere at the end of one of those blackthorn-hedged byways lay the village of Ballybucklebo. But which road should he take? And, he reminded himself, there was more to that question than simple geography.Most of his graduating classmates from the medical school of the Queen&#x2019;s University of Belfast had clear plans for their careers. But he hadn&#x2019;t a clue. General practice? Specialize? And if so, which speciality? Barry shrugged. He was twenty-four, single, no responsibilities. He knew he had all the time in the world to think about his medical future, but his immediate prospects might not be bright if he were late for his five o&#x2019;clock appointment, and though finding a direction for his life might be important, his most pressing need was to earn enough to pay off the loan on the car.He scowled at the map and retraced the road he had travelled from Belfast, but the Six Road Ends lay near the margin of the paper. No Ballybucklebo in sight. What to do?He looked up, and as he did he glimpsed himself in the rearview mirror. Blue eyes looked back at him from a clean-shaven oval face. His tie was askew. No matter how carefully he tied the thing, the knot always managed to wander off under one collar tip. He understood the importance of first impressions and did not want to look scruffy. He tugged the tie back into place, then tried to smooth down the cowlick on the crown of his fair hair, but up it popped. He shrugged. It would just have to stay that way. He wasn&#x2019;t going to a beauty contest&#x2014;it was his medical credentials that would be scrutinized. At least his hair was cut short, not like the style affected by that new musical group, the Beatles.One last glance at the map confirmed that it would be of no help in finding his destination. Perhaps, he thought, there would be a signpost at the junction. He got out of the vehicle, and the springs creaked. Brunhilde, as he called his car, was protesting about the weight of his worldly goods: two suitcases, one with his meagre wardrobe, the other crammed with medical texts; a doctor&#x2019;s medical bag tucked under the bonnet; and a fly rod, creel, and hip waders lying in the backseat. Not much to show for someone possessing a medical degree, he thought, but with any luck his finances would soon take a turn for the better&#x2014;if he could just find Ballybucklebo.He leant against the car door, conscious that his five-foot-eight, slightly built frame barely gave him enough height to peer over Brunhilde&#x2019;s domed roof, and even standing on tiptoe he could see no evidence of a signpost. Perhaps it was hidden behind the hedges.He walked to the junction and looked around to find a grave deficiency of signposts. Maybe Ballybucklebo&#x2019;s like Brigadoon, he thought, and only appears every hundred years. I&#x2019;d better start humming &#x201c;How Are Things in Glocca Morra?&#x201d; and hope to God one of the little people shows up to give me directions.He walked back to the car in the warmth of the Ulster afternoon, breathing in the gorse&#x2019;s perfume from the little fields at either side of the road. He heard the liquid notes of a blackbird hiding in the fuchsia that grew wild in the hedgerow, the flowers drooping purple and scarlet in the summer air. Somewhere a cow lowed in basso counterpoint to the blackbird&#x2019;s treble.Barry savoured the moment. He might be unclear about what his future held, but one thing was certain. Nothing could ever persuade him that there was anywhere, anywhere at all, he would choose to live other than here in Northern Ireland.No map, no signpost, and no little people, he thought as he approached the car. I&#x2019;ll just have to pick a road and... He was pleasantly surprised to see a figure mounted on a bicycle crest the low hill and pedal sedately along the road.&#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; Barry stepped into the path of the oncoming cyclist. &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; The cyclist wobbled, braked, and stood, one foot on the ground and the other on a pedal. For a moment Barry wondered if his hopes of meeting a leprechaun had been fulfilled. &#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; he said.He was addressing a gangly youth, innocent face half hidden under a Paddy hat, but not hidden well enough to disguise a set of buckteeth that Barry decided would be the envy of every hare in the Six Counties. He carried a pitchfork over one shoulder and wore a black worsted waistcoat over a collarless shirt. His tweed trousers were tied at the knees with leather thongs that the locals called &#x201c;nicky tams.&#x201d;&#x201c;Grand day,&#x201d; he remarked.&#x201c;It is.&#x201d;&#x201c;Och, aye. Grand. Hay&#x2019;s coming along fine, so it is.&#x201d; The youth picked his nose.&#x201c;I wonder if you could help me?&#x201d;&#x201c;Aye?&#x201d; The cyclist lifted his hat and scratched his ginger hair. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for Ballybucklebo.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d; His brow knitted, and the head scratching increased.&#x201c;Can you tell me how to get there?&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d; He pursed his lips. &#x201c;Boys-a-boys, thon&#x2019;s a grand wee place, so it is.&#x201d;Barry tried not to let his growing exasperation show. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it is, but I have to get there by five.&#x201d;&#x201c;Five? Today, like?&#x201d;&#x201c;Mmm.&#x201d; Barry bit back the words &#x201c;No. In the year 2000.&#x201d; He waited.The youth fumbled in the fob pocket of his waistcoat, produced a pocketwatch, and consulted it, frowning and muttering to himself. He looked at Barry. &#x201c;Five? You&#x2019;ve no much time left.&#x201d;&#x201c;I know that. If you could just&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d;&#x201c;Please?&#x201d;&#x201c;Och, aye.&#x201d; He pointed to the road that lay straight ahead. &#x201c;Take that road.&#x201d;&#x201c;That one?&#x201d;&#x201c;Aye. Follow your nose &#x2019;til you come to Willy John McCoubrey&#x2019;s red barn.&#x201d;&#x201c;Red barn. Right.&#x201d;&#x201c;Now you don&#x2019;t turn there.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;&#x201c;Not at all. Keep right on. You&#x2019;ll see a black-and-white cow in a field&#x2014;unless Willy John has her in the red barn for milking. Now go past her, and take the road to your right.&#x201d; As he spoke, the youth pointed to the left side of the road.Barry felt a mite confused. &#x201c;First right past the black-and-white cow?&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her,&#x201d; he said, continuing to point to the left. &#x201c;From there on, it&#x2019;s only a wee doddle. Mind you, sir...&#x201d; He started to mount his rusty machine. Then he delivered the rest of the sentence with the solemnity of a priest givin...</p></p><h2>Watch &amp; Clock Encyclopedia</h2><p>Contains over three thousand alphabetically-organized entries from early designs, antique clocks and names of parts, to charts of important dates with thirteen hundred explanatory drawings</p><p></p><h2>A Cruel Courtship</h2><p>It is Scotland, 1297.

He is the author of many books, including <i>The Water Dragon</i>, <i>The Little Monkey King's Journey</i> and <i>The Snake Goddess Colors the World</i>.Gr 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;Created and published in China, this tale honoring the Chinese zodiac is told in both Chinese and English. Perhaps originating in folklore&#x2014;or maybe not&#x2014;it's told very much in the style of legend. In Sheep Horn Village, a doctor once rescued a wounded sheep who returned his kindness when a monstrous animal appeared near the village, demanding that each family give him a child. Transforming herself into a beautiful girl, the sheep maiden leads the monster away and astray. Li's simple scenes, nicely sketched in blue and brown watercolors in ample white space, deftly depict the villagers, their homes, and the rugged countryside. The monster is an enormous tigerlike creature, and Sheep Beauty a modest young woman. When the monster has been lured away, the young woman again becomes a sheep and leaves the village. It's not the end of the story, though, and once more the sheep will magically intervene. Occasionally the English translation is a bit awkward, but the story is well shaped. A closing note lists the lunar years of the sheep in the Western calendar (2015) and describes the personal traits of "the docile and compassionate sheep." The story offers many reading and storytelling possibilities in addition to introducing and demonstrating the eighth sign of the Chinese zodiac.&#x2014;Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</p><h2>Bernard Palissy</h2><p>This is a biography of Palissy &amp; his art.

But you may not realize just how tired you really are or recognize the exact ways in which you're exhausted. After all, fatigue can take many forms. One woman feels chronically wiped out with a pervasive tiredness that isn't relieved by getting enough sleep, while another starts the day with plenty of vim and vigor but runs out of energy quickly. Meanwhile, a third woman might have a vague but enduring sense of malaise or listlessness, while another feels physically weak, apathetic, and emotionally vulnerable on a regular basis. The point is, there are many different faces of exhaustion, literally and figuratively speaking.<br><br>To address your personal energy crisis and repair the elements that are depleting your vitality, it's important to be sensitive to the specific messages your body is sending. You need to listen closely to what your exhaustion is telling you. Otherwise, how can you possibly expect to reverse your state of depletion and restore your vigor to healthier levels? It's not enough to recognize that your energy balance is out of whack; you need to figure out why it's off kilter. Could it be because you're sick with an underlying medical condition? Could your thought patterns, your stress level, or your general state of mind be dragging and slowing you down? Could lifestyle habits such as your food choices or eating patterns, sleep practices, or exercise routines (or lack thereof) be creating an energy leak that's draining you physically and/or mentally? Or have you created a work or social schedule for yourself that's so demanding that it causes you to run out of fuel without ample opportunities for replenishing your energy reserves?<br><br>The first step toward breaking the exhaustion cycle is to identify and understand what is zapping your energy and contributing to your profound sense of fatigue. Then, and only then, can you begin to take steps to revitalize and reclaim your vigor and well-being. So let's start that identification process!<br><br>GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF FATIGUE<br><br>First, let's establish a sense of how profound your fatigue is and how it affects you. Read each of the following questions and pick the response that best describes you.<br><br>1. Would you say that you become fatigued easily?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>2. Is your motivation or desire to do things lower when you feel fatigued?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>3. Do you have trouble starting new things?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>4. Does your fatigue limit you or cause problems in your life?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>5. Does your fatigue interfere with your ability to carry out and fulfill certain responsibilities in your life?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>6. Does fatigue affect your work, social, or family life?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>7. Has your fatigue affected how you socialize with friends or family or engage in leisure activities?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>8. Does your fatigue affect your thinking skills, concentration, communication abilities, or other aspects of mental functioning?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>9. Does your fatigue interfere with your ability to function physically?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>10. Does exercising give you an enduring sensation of tiredness?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>11. Does your fatigue affect your eating or sleeping habits or other aspects of your behavior?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>12. Has your fatigue affected how you take care of yourself (with bathing, dressing, and the like)?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>13. Has your fatigue affected your sex life?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>14. Does fatigue rate among your three most incapacitating symptoms?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>15. Do you feel distressed or bothered by your fatigue?<br><br>Rarely Sometimes Often<br><br>If you answered "often" three or more times, you are in need of an antidote for your exhaustion and could use an infusion of fresh, vibrant energy. Fatigue is taking a serious toll on your life, affecting the way you feel and function, your behavior and attitude. And if it hasn't already, it probably will affect your physical or emotional health in the not-too- distant future.<br><br>The same is true if you answered "sometimes" five or more times. This is your wake-up call to take your exhaustion seriously.<br><br>If you chose "rarely" for many of your responses, you're not entirely out of the energy-drain zone. There's always room for improvement, and this book will show you how to fix your exhaustion triggers and boost your energy in a sustainable fashion. If, however, you chose "rarely" for every single answer--granted, it's a remote possibility, assuming your responses were honest and accurate--then you might want to pass this book along to a tired friend who could truly benefit from reading it.<br><br>Now let's try to pinpoint the patterns and rhythms of your fatigue as well as the lifestyle factors that may be contributing to it. Read the following questions and choose the responses that best describe your exhaustion.<br><br>1. At what time(s) of the day is your fatigue most pronounced?<br><br>a. Late morning<br><br>b. Midday<br><br>c. Late afternoon<br><br>d. Evening<br><br>2. Which of the following statements best describes your sleep-wake patterns?<br><br>a.

I tend to skimp on sleep to get more done during the day and evening hours.<br><br>d. I feel as though I get enough sleep and start the day feeling reasonably rested.<br><br>3.

I usually skip breakfast but eat lunch and dinner.<br><br>c. I eat three square meals a day with lunch or dinner being the biggest meal of the day.<br><br>d. I often have multiple small meals throughout the day.<br><br>4. How would you describe your food preferences?<br><br>a. I'm a junk-food junkie--if it's fried, salty, or sweet, I'll probably love it.<br><br>b. I'm a serious carb lover--breads, pastas, and grains are the mainstay of my diet.<br><br>c. I'm a meat-and-potatoes kind of gal--I like hearty meals that fill me up.<br><br>d. I eat a primarily plant-based diet with moderate portions of lean protein.<br><br>5. How stressed out do you feel on a daily basis?<br><br>a. I am flirting with stress overload; I feel tense and anxious all the time.<br><br>b. I spend much of the day feeling anxious about the challenges and responsibilities I have to deal with.<br><br>c. I generally feel calm until something upsetting happens--then my stress level soars.<br><br>d. I experience ups and downs in the stress department but feel like I have it under control.<br><br>6. How well do you manage your stress?<br><br>a. I don't. If anything, it manages me; I often feel like I'm at the mercy of the stresses and strains in my life.<br><br>b. So-so. Sometimes I remain calm under pressure, but sometimes I cave into it and feel like a wreck.<br><br>c. I try to hold on to my can-do spirit and try to control what I can and let go of what I can't--but sometimes stress gets the upper hand.<br><br>d. I carve out at least 10 minutes a day to decompress with meditation, deep breathing exercises, or other relaxation strategies--whether I'm feeling stressed or not.<br><br>7. Which of the following best describes your exercise habits?<br><br>a. Erratic at best--often I do little more than move my fork to my mouth.<br><br>b. I spend much of the day sitting at my desk, but I try to go for a daily walk.<br><br>c. I'm an addict--I kill myself at the gym with daily extreme-intensity workouts.<br><br>d. I do moderate-intensity exercise on a regular basis and feel as though it boosts my energy.<br><br>8. How do you typically use your spare time?<br><br>a. I try to catch up on all the things I never seem to get done on my to-do lists.<br><br>b. I spend a lot of my so-called downtime trying to recover from exhaustion.<br><br>c. I often worry about work, my finances, my family, or other issues--and find it hard to relax.<br><br>d. I spend time with loved ones and engage in hobbies or other activities I enjoy in order to recharge my batteries.<br><br>9. Which of the following is your usual beverage of choice?<br><br>a. I'm a java junkie and often drink coffee or strong tea all day long.<br><br>b. I drink a lot of soda--it's refreshing and sweet, which boosts my mood.<br><br>c. I often count the hours until it's cocktail time and don't focus on fluids until then.<br><br>d. I try to drink water or watered-down juices throughout the day.<br><br>10. In a perfect world, which of the following best describes the way you'd like to be able to move through life?<br><br>a. I just want to regain the feeling that I can make it through each day without crashing and burning.<br><br>b. I want to stop worrying about running out of gas and falling further and further behind on things.<br><br>c. I want to feel more in control of my life, my moods, and my energy.<br><br>d. I want to feel like a force--strong, capable, unstoppable, really.<br><br>Before I tell you how to interpret your responses to these questions, it's worth giving yourself a reality check (or reminder). In the media, the myth of the superwoman or supermom is alive and kicking--but it's a fantasy. It's not real or attainable. It's true that you may know a few women who seem to have mastered the juggling act--they look polished or professional; every aspect of their lives (their homes, their children, their careers, their fitness regimens) seems to be in stellar shape; and they often seem ready, willing, and eager to add more to their already full plate of responsibilities. But think about this: How much do you really know about the inner workings of their lives?<br><br>They may have an entourage of help (nannies, housekeepers, personal assistants, chefs, trainers, and so on) at their disposal or the financial resources to continuously make their lives easier. They may have an extensive network of family members and friends who can step in at a moment's notice to help. Or they may work very hard to make it seem this way. Appearances can be deceiving, as we all know, and despite the happy face these perfectly put-together women show to the world, they may be privately grappling with depression, exhaustion, or deeply rooted insecurities. They may feel just as overwhelmed, stressed, or depleted as the rest of us do. So cut yourself some slack before playing the comparison game.<br><br>Here's another reality check: Some fatigue is natural and inevitable, especially for women. A modicum of fatigue could be a sign that you're living your life with full engagement and commitment--and you probably wouldn't want it to be any other way. So if you chose mostly d's on this questionnaire, you're actually doing pretty well. If you chose mostly b's or c's, you're in good company among the tired sisterhood who run out of fuel in the afternoon and tend to collapse into bed at the end of the day, feeling worn out, stressed out, and in danger of burning out. If you chose mostly a's, you may already be in that state of utter exhaustion, barely able to drag yourself through the day.<br><br>The point here isn't to judge yourself but to get a baseline sense of the level of exhaustion you're dealing with--and what it's trying to tell you. Then you can begin to take steps to recharge your body and mind and reclaim your vitality. The key steps are to track your levels of fatigue in a diary and do a 7-day fatigue-beating challenge (both detailed in Chapter 14). If your eating habits seem to be responsible for at least some of your lethargy, you can upgrade your dietary choices by consuming more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. If sedentary behavior is draining your energy, you'll want to move more and sit less. If insufficient or fragmented sleep is making you tired, it's time to make getting good quality shut-eye a priority by improving your sleep hygiene and consulting a sleep specialist if need be. If excessive stress is pushing you into the exhaustion zone, it's time to get a grip on your stress and find ways to relieve it or manage it better. In the pages that follow, you'll learn more about how these various aspects of your lifestyle can contribute to fatigue and discover how sneaky medical conditions (from anemia to autoimmune diseases, from fibromyalgia to type 2 diabetes) can drain your energy, too.<br><br>Armed with this knowledge, you'll be able to develop a customized energy- boosting plan that's likely to work for you, as you'll see in detail in Chapter 14. It doesn't matter how long you've been tired or how severe or mild your fatigue is. What is important is that you identify your current energy drains, repair them, and put an end to exhaustion. It is possible. I did it, and you can, too!</p><h2>The Dead Won&#39;t Die (Deadlands)</h2><p><b>In A World Of Death. . .</b><br><br>First, the dead rose up--and civilization fell.

However, once the shooting started, it sparked a ship-building arms race that continued throughout the war. This book examines the design and development of the warships built upon the lakes during the war, emphasizing their differences from their salt-water contemporaries. It then goes onto cover their operational use as they were pitted against each other in a number of clashes on the lakes that often saws ships captured, re-crewed, and thrown back against their pervious owners. Released in 2012 to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the outbreak of the war, this is a timely look at a small, freshwater naval war.</p><p>Mark Lardas holds a degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, but spent his early career at the Johnson Space Center doing Space Shuttle structural analysis, and space navigation.

This anthology seeks to overcome the existing dispersion of texts on documentary practices and offer new perspectives on this crucial theme. Authors include T.J. Demos, Okwui Enwezor, Carles Guerra, Jorg Heiser, Stefan Jonsson, Olivier Lugon, Jean-Pierre Rehm, Hito Steyerl, and Jan Verwoert. They discuss issues such as what the function of documentary art forms is in the context of globalizing media and an expanding art world. How do the operations of documentary forms change in the age of digital reproduction? Being part of the research project &#39;The Greenroom: Reconsidering the Documentary and Contemporary Art&#39; at the Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, this publication functions similar to a greenroom at a television station, where staff and guests meet before and after filming and engage in discussions which often differ from those conducted in the limelight.</p><p></p><h2>Dancers to remember: The photographic art of Gordon Anthony</h2><p>London England: Hutchinson and Co., 1980.

Now, twelve years later and three years after moving to live and work in the United States, Motion looks back once more to recreate a stunning biographical sequel - but this time in verse. Essex Clay rekindles, expands and gives a tragic resonance to subjects that have haunted the poet throughout his writing life. In the first part, he tells the story of his mother&#39;s riding accident, long unconsciousness and slow death; in the second, he remembers the end of his father&#39;s life; and in the third, he describes an encounter that deepens the poem&#39;s tangled themes of loss and memory and retrieval. Although the prevailing mood of the poem has a sweeping Tennysonian melancholy, its wealth of physical details and its narrative momentum make it as compelling as a fast-paced novel: a settling of accounts which admits that final resolutions are impossible.</p><p>Andrew Motion was Poet Laureate from 1999 to 2009 and is co-founder of the online Poetry Archive; in 2015 he was appointed a Homewood Professor in the Arts at Johns Hopkins University. He has received numerous awards for his poetry, including most recently the Ted Hughes Award (2015), and has published four celebrated biographies, a novella, The Invention of Dr Cake (2003) and a memoir, In the Blood (2006).

Roosevelt sought to restore the honor of the United States with a dramatic act of vengeance: a retaliatory bombing raid on Tokyo. On April 18, 1942, eighty brave young men, led by the famous daredevil Jimmy Doolittle, took off from a navy carrier in the mid-Pacific on what everyone regarded as a suicide mission but instead became a resounding American victory and helped turn the tide of the war. <i>The First Heroes</i> is the story of that mission. Meticulously researched and based on interviews with twenty of the surviving Tokyo Raiders, this is a true account that almost defies belief, a tremendous human drama of great personal courage, and a powerful reminder that ordinary people, when faced with extraordinary circumstances, can rise to the challenge of history.</p><p>Advance praise for Craig Nelson's THE FIRST HEROES: <br><br> "The Doolittle Raid was Franklin Roosevelt's answer to Pearl Harbor. The gutsy mission shocked the Japanese, electrified America, and determined the shape and tenor of the entire Pacific War. If you want to read one book to understand how a humbled America rose to defeat mighty Japan, you hold that book in your hands. Read about the original 'Mission Impossible' of World War II. Read about the boys who flew off into history, believing they would never come back. Read about the boys who were the first heroes." (James Bradley, author of <i>Flags of Our Fathers</i>) <br><br> "<i>The First Heroes</i> is epic in sweep. The story of the Doolittle Raid lifts off the page, as rich and engrossing as any legend, and Craig Nelson proceeds to bring to vivid life the dramatic story behind the story. This is an astonishing feat - the hours breathe with even the tiniest gesture of young men desperately fighting to stay alive, against the panorama of modern war and a turbulent century in the making. Nelson is an amazing storyteller." (Doug Stanton, author of <i>In Harm's Way</i>) <br><br> "In this passionate and intimate history, Craig Nelson reminds us that America's first response to Pearl Harbor was neither tepid nor undramatic, but rather one of warfare's boldest chapters of righteous revenge." (Hampton Sides, author of <i>Ghost Soldiers</i>) <br><br> "I vividly remember as a boy, in the demoralizing months following Pearl Harbor, the disbelief and elation that greeted news that American bombers had actually struck Tokyo! Now Craig Nelson has given us every detail, every secret, every story behind this raid, which first taught an insecure nation that we could hit this enemy and, in time, defeat him." (Joseph E. Persico, author of <i>Roosevelt's Secret War</i>) <br><br> "Craig Nelson has produced a book that is, quite simply, unforgettable. The First Heroes lives and moves with staggering power and vitality. I never wanted it to end." (Leon Bing, author of <i>Do or Die</i>) <br><br> "<i>The First Heroes</i> is the best kind of history: important, thoughtful, and wonderfully gripping. Craig Nelson has done a splendid job of making America's first victory in World War II seem so vital, so relevant, that reading it feels like living it." (Susan Isaacs, author of <i>Long Time No See</i> and <i>Compromising Positions</i>)Craig Nelson is the author of four previous books, including <b>The First Heroes</b> and <b>Let's Get Lost</b>. His writings have appeared in <b>Salon</b>, <b>The New England Review</b>, <b>Blender</b>, <b>Genre</b>, and a host of other publications.

In <i>Life Sentence,</i> David Ellis provides a briefcase-full of fresh variations on this familiar theme, crafting a tale that delivers many delights and only a few disappointments. Like his first book, the Edgar-winning <i>Line of Vision</i>, this is a legal thriller, but the setting is refreshingly unusual: the narrator, Jon Soliday, is the chief legal aide to a powerful state senator in an unnamed city that's obviously Chicago. So there's plenty of bare-knuckle political intrigue even before Jon finds himself the main suspect in a murder. <p> Ellis's prose is sharp, clear, and intelligent, and his cast of characters is vividly varied. The complex plot setup is occasionally clumsy, with loose ends left lying around in the open for too long. But by the end, Ellis has gathered them all in masterfully, not once but several times, as we see the key facts of the case--several murders, a cryptic blackmail note, a long-ago party that ended in tragedy--through completely different lenses, each creating a fresh perspective that points to a completely different culprit. Right up to its socko surprise finish, <i>Life Sentence</i> is an intellectually and emotionally satisfying thrill ride from a promising young writer. <i>--Nicholas H.

Liz has seen him around. It&#39;s hard to miss Max-- the tall, blond, blue-eyed senior stands out in her high-school crowd. So why is he such a loner? Max is in love with Liz. He loves the way her eyes light up when she laughs. And the way her long, black hair moves when she turns her head. Most of all, he loves to imagine what it would be like to kiss her. But Max knows he can&#39;t get too close. He can&#39;t let her discover the truth about who he is. Or really, what he is... Because the truth could kill her.</p><p><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> "One Sigourney Weaver and one Will Smith." Liz Ortecho slid two thick burgers onto the table -- one with avocado and sprouts, one with jalape�o peppers and cheese. </p><p> Then she waited. The customers in the booth were obviously tourists. And every tourist who came to the Crashdown Cafe had at least one question about...the Roswell Incident. </p><p> "So is your family from around here?" the guy in the <i>Lost in Space</i> T-shirt asked. The blond woman sitting across from him flipped open a battered notebook and stared at Liz. </p><p> "Yeah," Liz said. "My great-great-great-grandfather inherited a ranch outside town. My family's been in Roswell ever since." </p><p> The woman uncapped her pen. The man cleared his throat. Here it comes, Liz thought. </p><p> "So did any of your relatives ever tell you any stories about, you know, the UFO crash?" the guy asked. </p><p> These two were a total trip. I bet they have every episode of <i>The X-Files</i> on tape, Liz thought. </p><p> "Well..." Liz hesitated. "I guess it would be okay to show you." She pulled a worn black-and-white photo out of her pocket and gently placed it in front of them. "A friend of my grandmother's took this picture at the crash site -- before the government cleaned it up." </p><p> The two tourists leaned over the blurry photo and studied it carefully. </p><p> "Whoa," the woman mumbled. "Whoa." </p><p> "This looks exactly like the alien from the autopsy video," the guy exclaimed. "Same oversized head and small, hairless body. I've got to get it on my Roswell Incident web site." He reached for the photo. </p><p> "You'd be dead by the end of the week." Liz snatched the photo away. "Just because its been more than fifty years since the crash doesn't mean the air force wants the truth exposed. They still want everyone to believe that weather balloon story they used as a cover-up," she explained. </p><p> Liz glanced around the cafe nervously. She wanted to make sure her father wasn't in earshot. If Papa heard her telling this story, he'd rip off her head and feed it to her for breakfast. </p><p> "I shouldn't have shown this to you. Just forget about it, okay? You never saw it." Liz rushed back behind the counter. </p><p> Maria DeLuca shook her head, sending her blond curls flying around her face. "You are so bad." </p><p> "Hey, they'll have a great story to tell when they get home. And I'll have a great tip," Liz answered. </p><p> Maria sighed. "You and your great tips. I've never known such a money-hungry waitress." </p><p> Liz shrugged. "You know how I feel. I need as much money as I can get because --" </p><p> "One day after grad it's <i>adios</i> and <i>hasta la vista,</i> baby," Maria interrupted. "I know, I know You're not going to spend your life in a town that has two movie theaters, one bowling alley, one lame-o comedy club, one even more lame-o dance club, and thirteen alien-theme tourist traps. </p><p> Liz had to smile. Her best friend did an almost perfect impression of her. "I guess I say that a lot, huh?" </p><p> Maria grabbed a dish towel and started wiping down the counter. "Only ten times a day since fifth grade," she joked. </p><p> "If I didn't have five thousand relatives watching me all the time," Liz said, "maybe I could have some fun once in a while." </p><p> She sighed, imagining a life where she didn't have to worry about doing something -- anything -- that would make her large, loving extended family worry about her future. She was the first daughter in her family headed for college, and her family wanted to make sure that she stayed on track. And not turn out like her sister, Rosa. </p><p> Liz pulled a handful of change out of her pocket and dumped it on the counter. </p><p> "Wow," Maria said. "Great tips. Maybe I should get my own picture of a baby doll someone left out in the sun too long." Maria scrunched up her nose. "Though I don't know if I could do that whole 'you'd be dead by the end of the week' thing without cracking up." </p><p> "Just practice in front of the mirror. That's what I did," Liz told her. </p><p> "It would take a lot of practice," Maria complained. "Everyone always knows when I'm lying. My ten-year-old brother is a better liar than <i>me.</i> The guys my mom goes out with never believe me when I say how nice it is to meet them." </p><p> Liz snorted. "Big surprise." She popped open the cash register and traded her change for bills. Thirty-three more dollars for the Hasta la Vista Fund. Thirty-three seventy-three, actually. </p><p> The opening notes of the <i>Close Encounters</i> theme played as the cafe door swung open. Max Evans, tall and blond, with killer baby blues, and Michael Guerin, dark and intense, ambled over to the corner booth in the back. Both were students at Liz and Maria's high school. </p><p> "Of course they sit in <i>your</i> section," Maria grumbled. </p><p> Liz and Maria each covered six of the cafe's flying-saucer-shaped booths. They divided the dining room in half from front to back so they each got a couple of booths by the windows. Those were the most popular. </p><p> "You get the tourists and the cute guys, and I get those two," Maria continued. She jerked her chin toward the booth nearest the door. "They're having some big fight. They just scowl at me every time I get near them." </p><p> Liz glanced at the two men in the booth. One was big and beefy. The other was smaller but muscular. They were leaning across the table toward each other, talking intently. She couldn't hear what they were saying, but they both looked furious. </p><p> "I think you deserve a good table after dealing with those guys. You can take Max and Michael," Liz volunteered. </p><p> Maria narrowed her blue eyes. "Okay, what's going on?" </p><p> Liz wrapped her arm around Maria's shoulders. "You're my best friend. Can't I just do something nice for you out of the goodness of my heart?" </p><p> "Nope." Maria shrugged Liz's arm away. I repeat -- what's going on?" </p><p> "Nothing," Liz insisted. "I just feel like taking a little vacation from all the testosterone junkies." </p><p> Maria raised one eyebrow. "Translation, please." </p><p> "Guys," Liz explained. "I'm so tired of their...guyness." </p><p> "All guys aren't like Kyle Valenti, you know," Maria told her. "Take Alex. He's totally cool." </p><p> Alex Manes <i>was</i> totally cool. Liz could hardly believe she and Maria had only been friends with him for a year. She felt as if she'd known him forever. </p><p> "You're right. Alex is the best. But he doesn't count." </p><p> Maria frowned. "Why not?" </p><p> "'Cause he's <i>Alex,</i>" Liz said with a shrug. "He's not a guy guy. Not like Kyle. You should have seen Kyle after school today. He will not accept the fact that I won't go out with him again. He actually got down on his knees and followed me down the hall with his tongue hanging out, begging. All his friends were watching, laughing like the idiots they are." </p><p> It made Liz wish she knew karate. She could have really given his friends something to laugh about. </p><p> "How romantic. And that classy move didn't convince you to go out with him again?" Maria's voice rose in fake shock. </p><p> "Uh -- that would be <i>no.</i> And I'm not going out with anyone else for a while, either," Liz declared. "I'm going to stay home, rent chick flicks, take bubble baths, and wear comfy old sweatpants." </p><p> Liz was looking forward to it. To be fair, most guys she'd been out with -- not that there had been that many -- weren't losers like Kyle Valenti. Kyle actually had thought Liz would <i>enjoy</i> sitting next to him on the couch watching him play Nintendo. He hadn't even offered her a turn! </p><p> But even with the other guys, there had just been that "sameness" about them. </p><p> "My love life is pathetic," Liz mumbled. "I just need some time to myself, for myself." </p><p> "Well, I can mix you up some great herbal bath oils," Maria offered. "But if you stop dating, there are going to be some very unhappy boys at Ulysses F. Olsen High." </p><p> "Like who?" Liz demanded. </p><p> Maria glanced over at the booth, where Max and Michael were sitting. "Max Evans," she said. </p><p> "Max?" Liz repeated. "Max is my buddy. He's not interested in me like that." </p><p> "Oh, please," Maria shot back. "How could he not be interested? You look like some kind of Spanish princess or something with your long black hair and your amazing cheekbones. And let's not talk about your skin. Do you even know the word <i>zit?</i> Plus you're smart and --" </p><p> Liz held up both hands. "Stop!" </p><p> Maria was the most loyal person Liz knew. If you were her friend, she stuck by you no matter what. And Liz and Maria had been friends since the second grade, when they bonded over a hurt baby bird. </p><p> "Okay, I'll stop," Maria answered. "But believe me, Max Evans is more than interested. He probably has the words <i>Property of Liz Ortecho</i> tattooed on his chest. Max --" </p><p> "Hi, Michael!" Liz said loudly as Michael walked up to the counter. She hoped he hadn't heard any of their conversation. </p><p> "Hey." Michael raked his fingers through his jet black hair, making the top even more spiky. "I was wondering if you had a job application I could fill out." </p><p> It was hard for Liz to picture Michael working in the cafe, busing tables and making change and stuff. It seemed too normal, too ordinary for Michael. He should have a job as a Navy SEAL or something like that. Michael was always joking around, but there was a definite edge to him. </p><p> Liz reached under the counter and pulled out a pad of forms. "We don't have any openings right now. But I'll talk to my father, and as soon as something comes up I'll have him call you." </p><p> "Oh, I think you're going to be having some openings real fast," Michael answered in a serious tone. "Unless your dad likes waitresses who stand around gossiping instead of waiting on tables." He winked. </p><p> Maria threw her dish towel at him. Michael cracked up. </p><p> "I'll go," Maria said. She picked up two menus and followed Michael over to his booth. </p><p> Liz shot a quick glance over at Max -- and found herself staring directly into his bright blue eyes. They were such an unusual shade, strange and beautiful. Not the blue of the sky or of the ocean. </p><p> Max held Liz's gaze for a second, then he looked away. </p><p> Maria wasn't right about Max -- was she? Liz had known Max since third grade. He had been her lab partner since they were sophomores. But they never hung out outside of class. And Liz hadn't picked up on any vibe signaling that Max wanted to be more than friends. </p><p> Liz grabbed the nearest napkin holder and restocked it. What would it be like to go out with Max? He wasn't really her type. He was quiet. And kind of a loner. </p><p> He saw the world in a different way from most people. He said things that made Liz stop and think. Like when those scientists in Scotland cloned that sheep. A lot of people talked about who they would clone if they could -- scientists or athletes or movie stars. But Max was more interested in whether or not the soul could be cloned -- and if it couldn't, what that meant. Spending time with Max definitely wasn't boring. </p><p> Liz wiped a drop of milk off the counter. She moved the ketchup bottle up a fraction of an inch so it was exactly even with the mustard bottle. Then she stole another peek at Max. </p><p> No one could say the boy was homely, that was for sure. If there were a beefcake calendar of Ulysses F. Olsen High hotties, Max would be in it. Tall, blond, buff, with those blue, blue eyes... </p><p> Liz felt her face get hot. It was weird thinking of Max that way. Most of the time she forgot he was certifiably gorgeous. Max was just <i>Max.</i> She couldn't -- </p><p> "I don't want the money tomorrow. I want it now!" </p><p> The angry voice interrupted Lizs thoughts. She jerked her head up and saw everyone in the cafe staring at the men in the booth by the door. The beefy man clenched and unclenched his fists as he glared at the muscular man. </p><p> I'd better go get Papa out of the office, she thought. Their argument looks like it's about to get ugly. </p><p> Liz turned toward the door marked Employees Only. </p><p> "He's got a gun!" Maria screeched. </p><p> Liz spun back toward the dining room. Her heart slammed against her ribs. No. Oh no. That's all she could think. Over and over. </p><p> The muscular man held a gun to the beefy man's head. "You won't need any money if you're dead," he said. His voice was calm. Calm and cold. </p><p> Click. </p><p> The muscular man cocked the gun. </p><p> Liz wanted to run, she wanted to scream for help, but she was paralyzed. Her mouth refused to open. Her legs refused to move. </p><p> The beefy man gave a howl of fury. He launched himself across the table at the muscular man. </p><p> An eardrum-shattering explosion rocked the room. </p><p> Liz flew off her feet. She hit the wall behind her, then slumped to the ground. </p><p> She felt something warm and wet gushing across her stomach, soaking into her uniform. </p><p> "There's so much blood," Liz heard Maria cry. </p><p> But she sounded so far away. </p><p> So far... </p><p> <br> Max sprang up from his seat in the booth. Instantly Michael grabbed him by the arm and jerked him back into his seat. </p><p> "Let go of me," Max cried. "Liz could be dying. What are you doing?" </p><p> "No, what are <i>you</i> doing?" Michael tightened his grip on Max's arm. "Are you planning to heal her in the middle of a restaurant? Why not just send the government an invitation -- hi, I'm here, why don't you come on over and get me?" </p><p> Michael was right. Healing Liz would attract attention -- a lot of attention. But if he let Liz die when he knew he could save her... </p><p> That was just not an option. </p><p> "I'm willing to risk it," he told Michael. </p><p> "<i>You're</i> willing to risk it. But what about me? What about Isabel?" Michael demanded. </p><p> Max stared down at the table. He didn't answer. He couldn't answer. He would risk his own life for Liz. But how could he risk the lives of his sister and his best friend? </p><p> "If the government has proof that one of us exists, they'll know there are more. They won't stop searching until they find us -- <i>all</i> of us," Michael continued. </p><p> "I can't stop the bleeding!" Maria screamed from behind the counter. </p><p> Max's heart slammed against his ribs. Liz was dying! He bolted to his feet. "I'll think of something. I promise," he said in a rush. </p><p> Before Michael could stop him, Max raced to the counter and vaulted over it. Pain filled his heart as he stared down at Liz. He swallowed hard. </p><p> Maria held a thick towel over Liz's stomach. But nothing could stop the blood pouring from the gunshot wound. </p><p> Max heard Liz's father on the kitchen phone, giving the cafe's address to the ambulance. They're going to be too late, Max thought. He knew it. He could see it. </p><p> The halo of color surrounding Liz was usually a warm, rich amber that made Max wish he could wrap himself up in it. But now her aura had turned a dull, muddy brown. And it was growing darker by the second. </p><p> Darker and darker as her life force drained out of her. </p><p> Every person's aura was different, as unique as a fingerprint. But the only time anyone's aura turned black was at the moment of death. </p><p> Max...</p>Grade 6-9-Alien conspiracy fans will not be disappointed to learn that there really are aliens among us. Michael, Max, and Isabel were hidden on Earth in incubation pods after the famed spacecraft crash of 1947 and adopted by well-intentioned humans who didn't know their history. Now attending a high school in New Mexico, the teens are trying to remain unnoticed by Project Clean Slate, whose purpose is to capture aliens living in the United States. All would be fine except that Max has fallen in love with a human classmate, Liz, and is compelled to heal her with his alien ability when she is shot and sure to die without his intervention. This act has brought unnecessary attention in their direction and now they must protect their secret. Liz's best friends Maria and Alex join the group after they struggle with their own fears and concerns over what doing the right thing means. Readers who like a little romance in their science fiction might enjoy this novel, which introduces all of the characters and lays the groundwork for future struggles to keep their anonymity. Hard-core fans of the genre might find the plot unwieldy and difficult to believe as it offers glimpses of alien "magic" without any explanation.<br><i>Tracey Firestone, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The War Between the State: Northern California vs. Southern California</h2><p>Battle lines have been drawn. It&#x2019;s the North vs. the South once again. But this time it&#x2019;s the Bay Area Brahmins against the Angelenos; the cultured vs. the philistines; old money vs. new; literary vs. blockbuster; irrelevant vs. fabulous. Fortunately, this war hasn&#x2019;t produced any casualties, but rather a vast cache of stinging barbs, witticisms, and droll commentary on life and meaning in Southern California alongside haute attitude and preciousness in Northern California. Twain&#x2019;s infamous shot at L.A. ("a great place to live, but I wouldn&#x2019;t want to visit there") is matched by Gertrude Stein&#x2019;s enduring slam on Oakland ("there&#x2019;s no there there"). Of course, there are other fronts in this timeless clash &#x2014; San Francisco vs. East Bay; Berkeley vs. Hollywood; the San Fernando Valley vs. Civilization &#x2014; and Jon Winokur has visited them all in this hilarious compendium of cultural dish from the front lines.</p><p>Jon Winokur is the author of How to Win at Golf, The Rich Are Different, Advice to Writers, The Traveling Curmudgeon, and many other books.

In the first two chapters the author, one of his colleagues, explains how she met Rees Howells, the effect he had on her spiritual guidance and how he himself met with God and came to understand the need for intercession. In the remaining chapters the author introduces detailed notes that were taken at the time of Rees Howells&#39; Bible readings and his commentary on them. These passages, often quoting Howells verbatim, illuminate his ideas, and bring his teaching to life. Because of this, the book is one of the most important documents about Rees Howells, including as it does a valuable collection of original material, and will appeal to a wide range of evangelicals. The book contains a foreword by Norman Grubb, author of Rees Howells, Intercessor also published by The Lutterworth Press, and a preface by Rees Howells&#39; son, Samuel Rees Howells, Director of the Bible College of Wales.</p><p>Doris Ruscoe was a preacher in Derbyshire and was headmistress of the school for missionary&#39;s children founded by Rees Howells.

Even Christ cried out on the cross, "Oh God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" <i>Dark Night of the Soul</i>, a 16th-century mystical text written by the Carmelite monk St. John of the Cross, ranks among Christianity&#x2019;s most helpful answers to this enduring question. In St. John&#x2019;s vision of spiritual life, the pain of separation from God is to be embraced, not avoided. "The dark night is about being fully present in the tender, wounded emptiness of our own souls," explains translator Mirabai Starr--although she grants that modern culture makes such acceptance hard to attain. "We tend to see difficult feelings as a form of illness, which we hope to conquer, cure, and expel. [St. John of the Cross] has a far greater imagination of human life: his goal is not health but union with the divine." Several fine English translations of <i>Dark Night</i> already exist; Starr&#x2019;s, however, is distinguished by its ecumenism. Minimizing the explicit scriptural references of the original text, she makes the treasures of <i>Dark Night</i> more accessible to readers of all religious traditions. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.</p><h2>Falls of St. Anthony</h2><p>The Mississippi&#39;s major waterfall played an important role in the development of lumbering, flour milling, and hydroelectric power in Minneapolis.

Even then, it seemed as if the new coach accepted Starr only with reluctance, but the gamble paid off and the outstanding play of the young man helped lead the Packers to five championships in seven years plus several other winning seasons. Starr and Olderman (The Pro Quarterback) present a picture of Lombardi at variance with the general image; they show a man driven to push his players to the level of excellence he was sure each of them could achieve, certainly not a tyrant or a monster. The second part of the book, about Starr's disappointing years as the Green Bay coach, is less absorbing and comes as something of an anticlimax, particularly in its detailing of the games he masterminded. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.As a player and later a coach for the Green Bay Packers, Starr experienced both the extreme highs and lows of the game. His reflections on his two careers revolve around his struggles on and off the field. Among his trials were a demanding father, the death of a brother at an early age, a North/South culture clash, a son addicted to drugs, and an owner unimpressed with his coaching efforts. Generally, he has only kind words for players and coaches regardless of their reputations.

Caught between the Scylla of agricultural destitution in Korea and the Charybdis of industrial depression in Japan, migrant Korean peasants arrived on Japanese soil amid extreme instability in the labor and housing markets. In <i>The Proletarian Gamble</i>, Ken C. Kawashima maintains that contingent labor is a defining characteristic of capitalist commodity economies. He scrutinizes how the labor power of Korean workers in Japan was commodified, and how these workers both fought against the racist and contingent conditions of exchange and combated institutionalized racism.<p></p><p>Kawashima draws on previously unseen archival materials from interwar Japan as he describes how Korean migrants struggled against various recruitment practices, unfair and discriminatory wages, sudden firings, racist housing practices, and excessive bureaucratic red tape. Demonstrating that there was no single Korean &#x201c;minority,&#x201d; he reveals how Koreans exploited fellow Koreans and how the stratification of their communities worked to the advantage of state and capital. However, Kawashima also describes how, when migrant workers did organize&#x2014;as when they became involved in <i>R&#x14d;s&#x14d;</i> (the largest Korean communist labor union in Japan) and in <i>Zenky&#x14d;</i> (the Japanese communist labor union)&#x2014;their diverse struggles were united toward a common goal. In <i>The Proletarian Gamble</i>, his analysis of the Korean migrant workers' experiences opens into a much broader rethinking of the fundamental nature of capitalist commodity economies and the analytical categories of the proletariat, surplus populations, commodification, and state power.</p></p><p>"This book establishes Ken C. Kawashima not simply as one of the best students of modern Japanese history in the world, but as one with a rare facility for effective use of theory amid a plethora of primary sources in Japanese and Korean.

Their "father," Pasco, a small-time trader with an ancient spaceship, originally assembled them from spare genetic material and personality programs, but he commits suicide while in the throes of a depression, leaving his children to fend for themselves. Ubu compounds their problems by making an unwise business move, putting them deeply in debt--in danger of losing the ship and facing a life of virtual indenture.

Slender, with a bald spot on top of his head, he sported a cane that he didn't need and wore pince-nez glasses that attached to the bridge of his nose with a spring-and even, incredibly enough, spats. He looked as though he had stepped out of an illustration for a men's haberdashery. He was like James Mason, but with a Russian accent. &nbsp;Mr. Shorr was a prodigy maker. He was also a pianist of some distinction, and he dressed the part. He was the pianist of the San Francisco Symphony; he accompanied Yehudi Menuhin, a local boy, when he was in town. But his real reputation ultimately derived from his students. There was a huge concentration of so-called child geniuses around San Francisco in those days. Shorr had taught Menuhin's sisters, Hephzibah and Yalta. He taught a girl named Laura Dubman, who gave her debut recital at the age of five and was supposed to be a rising piano talent (she later worked at MGM and taught Katharine Hepburn how to look like she was really playing the piano as Clara Schumann in Song of Love). He taught Ruth Slenczynska, who was really a big deal for a while, until she had a nervous breakdown in her teens that put her career on hiatus for a few decades. He later taught Stephen Kovacevich, who went on to be a star soloist in the generation after mine. And he taught me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>His manner was just as taut and crisp and old school as his appearance. In lessons, he focused on technique. "Technique&#x201d; meant, of course, Russian technique, the classic approach for virtuosos: for Mr. Shorr, that was the only technique there was. Our fingers were to be curved over the keys and raised and lowered like little hammers. Physiologically, this approach, widespread as it is, doesn't actually make sense, and I suspect Mr. Shorr might have done harm to some players, although many of his students did go on to careers all over the world. It wasn't much fun, though. If you played a clinker, he all but rapped you on the fingers with his cane. He never actually did that, but you felt he might. When I was six or seven and trying with all my might to please him, it wasn't long before tears of frustration would rise to the surface. &nbsp;But he wasn't an unkind man. He could also be rather paternalistic. Not that he would exactly comfort me when I began to cry, but after it happened he invariably took me out to lunch, for lamb chops. There was obviously method to his madness. He didn't succeed in molding me to the Russian technique, but to this day I have retained a marked love of lamb chops.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I can't actually remember a time when I wasn't playing the piano. I started when I was four years old, and my whole life came very quickly to revolve around the instrument-an upright piano, in the living room of whatever San Francisco apartment we happened to be living in at the moment. We moved around a lot. The piano was my mother's idea. My parents didn't have any real connection to music, but for my mother the instrument represented, as it did for many immigrants, a gateway to a new and better world. &nbsp;My father, Isidor Fleisher, was straight off the boat. He was born in Odessa, and his family emigrated to the United States with him when he was thirteen to join his brother, who had gone on ahead and established himself. He met my mother one summer night on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, when the sweltering heat had driven everyone out of their apartments and up onto the rooftops and fire escapes in search of a breath of fresh air. Those were different days.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>My mother was born in Chelm, a little town in Poland that is known, in Jewish folklore, as a center of foolishness. The traditional stories about the stupidity of the Chelmers have been taken up and elaborated by authors like Sholem Aleichem and Isaac Bashevis Singer; you could call them the original Polish jokes. They say that when God created the world, he sent out an angel with two bags, one filled with wisdom and one with foolishness: the latter, being heavier, dragged the angel down, snagged on a mountaintop, ripped open, and spilled its contents all over Chelm. Thereafter, the Chelmers were an idiosyncratic bunch. For instance, the city fathers decided one day that they wanted trees in front of the courthouse-so the Chelmers picked up the courthouse and moved it into the forest. My mother, of course, wanted nothing to do with that sort of silliness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>My parents didn't have a lot of formal education. My father was a milliner. He made ladies' hats, little pillboxes, out of straw. I have no idea where he learned to do that. He came out to San Francisco at the behest of an uncle, who was manufacturing hats for the navy. I'm quite sure the navy hats were only the remotest preparation for what my father ended up doing in San Francisco. Somewhere along the way, he lost the c in his last name, because while his brothers and sisters all went by "Fleischer," my immediate family has always been plain "Fleisher." Perhaps he wanted something that sounded more American. He had a little shop on Geary Street, catty-corner to the Clift Hotel. One day he came home quite excited because a lovely red-headed girl had come in and bought one of his hats and then told him that her name was Lucille Ball. That really perked him up. He didn't have that kind of clientele all the time, but he became successful enough to open a second shop on Fillmore Street. My mother ran that one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>My mother, Bertha, was a strong, strong personality. I think she was part Tartar: dark skin, firm features, and stubborn. She was also a little bit crazy. She was fixated on getting the best for her family, and she would do whatever it took to achieve that end. She was certainly driven. She came over to America on her own, at the age of twenty, and she married my father two years later. Even without education, she was keenly aware that there were higher things in life. In her later years, she would sit and read Emerson by the hour; she appeared to find great comfort in that. For her, that was just one example of the kinds of things that could enrich one's life and bring some kind of peace and tranquility and satisfaction. Music, evidently, was another. One of my early publicity biographies states that she was a singer herself. That&#x2019;s complete nonsense. I suspect that someone asked her a question in such away that by omission she allowed this misapprehension to continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She certainly had big dreams for me. I was going to be either the first Jewish president or a great concert pianist. It's fortunate that my talents were apportioned in such a way that I was able to fulfill at least one of those goals. It doesn't always work out that way. &nbsp;The piano was purchased for my brother, Ray, five and a half years older than I, who started lessons when he was around nine years old. In those days-the early 1930s-teachers, like doctors, made house calls; they came to you. Ray would come home from school and the teacher would arrive, and I would curl up in a corner of the big sofa in the living room and listen to my brother&#x2019;s lesson. After the teacher left, Ray would go out and play in the park with his friends, and I would go to the piano and redo his entire lesson, copying everything the teacher had asked of him. It wasn't long before my parents decided to switch the lessons to me. That's how it all began. At least, that&#x2019;s how the story goes in our family.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>My first teacher was a woman named Lillian Lanier, who taught me the notes and keys, but it was soon obvious to everyone that I needed more of a challenge. Mr. Shorr was supposed to be the best in San Francisco, so off to Mr. Shorr I went. I was, of course, too special to go to regular school like other children. I was enrolled briefly in kindergarten, but it seemed like such a waste of time. We had to take naps every afternoon on straw mats on a hard floor, and I objected to this fairly strenuously. Certainly my mother saw the whole project as detracting from precious hours I might otherwise have spent practicing. Accordingly, I was withdrawn from kindergarten after two weeks and set up with a succession of private tutors in a range of subjects, which constituted my formal education for the rest of my childhood. I've long thought of entitling my autobiography I Was a Kindergarten Dropout. &nbsp;So for the rest of my childhood, my brother, Ray, was the one who went to school and had friends and a normal life. And I was the one who practiced. <br><br>I can't say it was a happy childhood. Since my mother worked, I was supervised by governesses, like a woman named Muriel Fraser, who was with us for several years. She was a rather uncompromising figure. She used to wallop me with wooden coat hangers across the back of my legs when I wasn't good. She became a nun after she left us. &nbsp;San Francisco had a considerable musical life when I was a child, even if most of its institutions-the symphony, the opera-were relatively new. Compared with Los Angeles, it was downright cosmopolitan. The San Francisco Symphony was founded in 1911, and the San Francisco Opera in 1923; they both moved into the brand-new War Memorial Opera House in 1932, when I was four. But opera in San Francisco went back a lot farther than that. A notorious episode in American opera history was the 1906 Metropolitan Opera tour that placed Enrico Caruso in San Francisco at exactly the moment of the great earthquake and the ensuing fire, an experience that left the tenor shaken and traumatized and that he used as a reason never to return to San Francisco. <br><br>Not everyone on the tour had the same reaction. Alfred Hertz, the star conductor on that tour (he described the earthquake as sounding like a &#x201c;mezzo forte roll on a cymbal or gong"), ultimately developed such a rapport with the city that he settled there in 1915 (the year San Francisco hosted the World's Fair) as the second-ever music director of the fledgling San Francisco Symphony and stayed there for the rest of his life. &nbsp;Hertz was as bald as a billiard ball, with a formidable dark, bushy beard that was salt-and-pepper gray by the time I knew him and round wire-framed glasses: a bona fide representative of the great European tradition, straight out of the concert halls of Gustav Mahler. His appearance was also notoriously easy to caricature (Caruso left a drawing of him among his affectionate send-ups of his Met Opera colleagues). Crippled as a child by what they used to call infantile paralysis-that is, polio-he walked with a cane for all of his adult life, but this did not diminish his notable vigor. He had aloud laugh, an ear for a joke, and an eye for a pretty girl. "Come for dinner, stay for breakfast!" he used to say, laughing, while his wife, Lilly, made derogatory noises in the background.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He was also a formidable and renowned musician. In the early years of the twentieth century he led a number of world premieres at the Metropolitan Opera, as well as the first American performances of Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier and Salome. (The opera, based on the Oscar Wilde play and depicting Salome kissing John the Baptist's severed head, created such a scandal in 1907 that it was withdrawn and not performed again until 1934.) Even more notorious, though, was the first American production of Richard Wagner&#x2019;s Parsifal. This was a monumental event-front-page news for many American papers-because Wagner had forbidden the performance of the work anywhere other than his own theater in Bayreuth, so the Met's doing it was tantamount to sacrilege in the eyes of many European music lovers. Mind you, the Met production didn't take place until 1903, twenty years after Wagner's death, but the prohibition was actively upheld by Wagner's acolytes, first and foremost his widow, Cosima. Cosima Wagner's clout in Europe was such that after Hertz conducted that Parsifal, he never conducted in an opera house in Germany again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Europe's loss (and the Met's, after Hertz left the company in 1915 over artistic differences with its director) was San Francisco's gain. Hertz's stature was such that he was able to attract a whole new caliber of player to San Francisco, both as soloists and as orchestra players. The violinist Louis Persinger, for instance, was the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic before Hertz lured him to take that position at the San Francisco Symphony. With this kind of musician on its roster, the San Francisco Symphony quickly developed into a serious professional orchestra. It was also, to Hertz's credit, the first American orchestra to admit women as anything other than harpists. And the presence of so many good musicians doubtless contributed to the child-prodigy boom in San Francisco in the 1920s and 1930s.There were a striking number of talented children performing around the city. Persinger himself taught Menuhin, Ruggiero Ricci, and Isaac Stern, among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Hertz was also forward-looking. He was committed to education and outreach-words that didn't have as much currency in the classical music world in those days as they do now-and was happy to explore new ways of reaching audiences. In 1922, for example, he was the only conductor willing to gamble on leading a motley series of outdoor orchestra concerts with the brand-new Los Angeles Philharmonic in the Hollywood Hills-the first season of the Hollywood Bowl, a summer series he continued to lead for years as it rapidly became a popular fixture of the country's musical life. He was also eager to explore recording and radio. The San Francisco Symphony became one of the first American orchestras to make commercial recordings, starting in the1920s. And after he retired from the symphony in 1930, he continued to lead pioneering series of regular radio broadcasts. He went on in the late 1930s to found the orchestra of the Northern California Chapter of the Works Progress Administration, the WPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>More to the point, as far as my own story is concerned, was Hertz's eye for young talent. Three young artists were his particular prot�g�s in his San Francisco years. There was Menuhin, who, of course, got everyone&#x2019;s attention in San Francisco when he was young. There was the conductor Leslie Hodge, who led a number of the WPA Orchestra concerts. And there was me. Most of my first orchestral concerts-at the advanced age of eight and nine years old-were with that WPA orchestra, often performing in schools. I used to play the first or third movement-never, for some reason, the slow movement-of Beethoven's B-flat concerto, the second concerto. They didn't want to tax a child's powers of concentration by making me play, or the students listen to, the whole thing.</p></p><h2>Monstrous Affections: An Anthology of Beastly Tales</h2><p><b>Fifteen top voices in speculative fiction explore the intersection of fear and love in a haunting, at times hilarious, darkly imaginative volume.</b><br><br>Predatory kraken that sing with &#x2014; and for &#x2014; their kin; band members and betrayed friends who happen to be demonic; harpies as likely to attract as repel.

Castellucci, who covered the case for the Rockland Journal-News, succeeds in piecesing together a brisk, straightforward narrative of complex events that ultimately joined Boudin and a violent group together in "political" crime. Going beyond the robbery and trial (Boudin was found guilty), the author traces Boudin's life as a privileged young woman torn between her bourgeois past and radical principles, and her family's roots in political activism. Although a solid factual account of the "Big Dance" (the robbery's code name), Castellucci's book will nonetheless leave many wishing for a deeper exploration of this group and its "hopelessly mixed" motives. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Castellucci chronicles the events surrounding the 1981 $1.6-million Brink's robbery that cost the lives of one guard and two Nyack, N.Y., policemen and exposed a fanatical underground political cell that included Kathy Boudin, the notorious Sixties radical. The author, a journalist who covered the case, exposes the backgrounds of the participants and supporters: an odd assortment, many like Boudin who began as idealists and protesters, but took their beliefs to a fanaticism that preached robbery and murder. The author was unrelenting in his research of legal records, court testimony, and FBI interviews, but unfortunately was unable to interview Boudin or any members of "The Family." However, The Big Dance provides unique documentation of a thin slice of life hidden from the public.

Since childhood, I&#x2019;ve believed I would die in my sleep.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind&#x2019;s eye, I picture myself sandwiched between Mama and Daddy as we knelt beside my bed, speaking the prayer together. It always seemed like they were sucking up all the oxygen, leaving me with none. I thought I might suffocate. But I could smell Mama so well. She hadn&#x2019;t had her nightly bath yet, so she still smelled of southern cooking and a hint of Chanel No. 5. The smallest amount behind her ears and inside the crook of her arm was enough for it to linger wherever she wandered in the house. I loved the smell of Mama.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the expression on her face when she opened the box one Christmas morning. By the look of wonder, I knew she loved it. She blushed under Daddy&#x2019;s admiring gaze as she dabbed some on her wrist and lifted her arm to his face. As I watched, a bubble, like the ones I used to blow with those huge pieces of sugar-coated bubble gum, started deep inside me and got bigger and bigger. It was a rare moment of sheer joy in our family.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later, a pin of reality burst the facade, but in that moment...joy. I&#x2019;m glad my mind took me back to that place, if only for a minute. I can remember Daddy as he was. And forgive what he became.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.<br></i><br>Present Day<br><b><i><br>Claudia<br></i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claudia hated this moment. Stopped at the tracks, watching the lights flash and hearing the bell clang. First in line, as the wall forms in front of her. The whistle growing louder as the engine nears. The rhythm of steel against steel, the train racing by, beating in her ears. Other cars had lined up behind her, hedging her in. Suffocating. Blocking any chance of escape.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could a heart really pound right out of its chest? She felt her breath coming in short bursts. Her phone beeped, but she couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to look for it. Closing her eyes tight, she gripped the steering wheel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her chest hurt, and she could smell the metallic tang of blood. The rest of her senses picked up the sensation. She could taste the iron, way back in her throat, and her ears pounded with the rhythm of her heartbeat. Then her hands felt a sticky warmth&#x2014;BJ&#x2019;s blood, soaking her cheerleading skirt. The wetness spread over her legs. She gasped and stared down at her lap. Her Diet Coke had spilled on her light tan linen pants. Still, she couldn&#x2019;t move.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter that the train had come and gone, still she sat, staring at the bare metal tracks. Her body shook all over. Vehicles sped around her, blaring their horns. People glared at her, some even shouting obscenities at her, but it was no use. She&#x2019;d become paralyzed. She didn&#x2019;t know how many minutes she sat there while the world swept by her, a still body in a raging storm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dull tap registered in her brain. She turned toward the sound and tried to focus on the man outside her window. He reached out and made another clipped, three-rap knock on the glass. Finally, recognition flashed, trying to convince her that everything was okay. She pressed the button and lowered the window for the waiting police officer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Claudia?&#x201d; His voice sent a shiver down her spine. Images sped through her mind, blurring her focus. &#x201c;Is there something wrong with your car?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice was a little deeper now than it had been ten years ago, but she could still hear it screaming, &#x201c;Leave her alone!&#x201d; And then the gunshot. She could feel herself fading again...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Claude!&#x201d; He reached in through the window and shook her shoulder. &#x201c;Come on, girl. I know what this is. I&#x2019;ve been there too. But snap out of it. You&#x2019;re in the middle of the street.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt herself slowly ascending, as though swimming from the bottom of a deep lake. At the surface, a ragged, cold breath filled her lungs. &#x201c;Casio.&#x201d; Tears filled her eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, baby,&#x201d; he said, his voice soft, taking her back to the days when he was quarterback, she was cheerleader, and everyone said they&#x2019;d be America&#x2019;s sweethearts. &#x201c;Can you drive the car into the parking lot?&#x201d; He pointed to the right where a mom-and-pop caf� sat practically empty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right behind you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took every ounce of willpower to slide the Tahoe into gear and drive toward the parking lot. Once she stopped, her lungs screamed and she could feel the breath-stealing, muscle-seizing horror of hyperventilation coming on. Casio appeared at the passenger side door. Clutching her chest, she pointed toward the glove box. &#x201c;Bag,&#x201d; she managed to gasp.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;A bag. In there!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh! Okay! Are you okay?&#x201d; Hang on.&#x201d; Casio opened the glove box and pulled out a paper bag, then brought it to her mouth. &#x201c;Breathe. In-out-in-out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did. Her lungs felt like they might burst as the panic spiked. &#x201c;Oh, God. It&#x2019;s just like that night.&#x201d; A scream vibrated in her throat, and she squelched it before it could pierce the air inside the Tahoe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Casio&#x2019;s hand pressed against her clammy neck. &#x201c;Now, listen, Claude. Keep breathing.&#x201d; His smooth-as-silk tone calmed her and evened out her breath. She tried to focus on his tone. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t like that night on the bus. No one is after you. The person with a gun was after BJ. No one else. It wasn&#x2019;t a random act or I wouldn&#x2019;t have just been shot in the arm. Right? If that man was on a killing spree, we&#x2019;d all be dead right now.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice was beginning to soothe her, and slowly, the words sank into her muddled brain. She set the bag in her lap and filled her lungs with a cleansing breath. &#x201c;Thanks, Casio,&#x201d; she whispered and tried to smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a hero.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His jaw clenched as he inhaled from a freshly lit cigarette and then passed it to her. &#x201c;Yep, that&#x2019;s what I am.&#x201d; He expelled a stream of smoke. &#x201c;A real hero.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sarcasm in his tone, Claudia regretted her choice of words. She reached across the seat and took his hand. &#x201c;We did what we could.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Too bad that doesn&#x2019;t make the dreams go away.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared into the horizon where clouds were beginning to roll their way. Silently, they sat, hand-in-hand, passing the cigarette between them, remembering that they shared a bond of pain and loss.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, for the moment, it made things calmer.</p><h2>In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day</h2><p>No Guts, No Glory.....Life&#39;s challenges are God&#39;s gifts to you....</p><p></p><h2>Valentine Friends</h2><p>The Rabbit family&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day party is filled with fun and surprises for everyone, including some special surprise valentines that show two best friends just how special Valentine&#39;s Day can be.</p><p></p><h2>Cat&#39;s Eye</h2><p>Controversial painter Elaine Risley returns from Vancouver for a retrospective of her work.

Eve (the name inscribed inside the front cover and then again above the heading for chapter 3) made pencil marks on nearly every paragraph of the book, underlining a phrase, highlighting many passages with strong vertical marks, scratching out some words that she seems to have found superfluous and even x-ing out whole sections that apparently missed their mark with her altogether. Two rusting paper clips isolate several pages, absent any marking at all. Anne Morrow Lindbergh&#39;s lyrical words are still relevant and presage so many of the themes of today&#39;s most popular books: simplicity, peaceful solitude, caring for the soul, a woman finding her place in society and life. I heard that the woman who had lived in the cabin had actually passed away some time before. Thank you, Eve, for your gift... from the sea.Reeve Lindbergh is the author of many books for both adults and children, including the memoirs Under a Wing and No More Words.</p><h2>Open Studios with Lotta Jansdotter: Twenty-Four Artists&#39; Spaces</h2><p>Internationally acclaimed designer Lotta Jansdotter reinvents the craft book and reinforces her global appeal with this rare glimpse into the studios of accomplished artists, crafters, and designers around the world.

Not only has she made exquisite and sexually provocative fans for her friend, but she has also coauthored with the Marquis a book about the infamous Spanish missionary, Bishop Landa, accusing him of massacres and other hideous abuses against the native population of the New World. The men of the court are so consumed with punishing the authors of this scandalous book that they are blinded to the folly of their own accusations against the Marquis.<br><br>The Fan-Maker's Inquisition is a novel about books and the reveries that enger them, about the intrinsic necessity of the sovereign imagination, and about the risks of passionate living and thinking.<br></p><p>&#34;A fan is like the thighs of a woman: it opens and closes.&#34; And so begins this lush, historical novel--a mixture of imagination and conceit, passion and suspense. In a tense courtroom during the French Revolution, a young fan-maker, renowned all over Paris for her sensual and graphic objets d&#39;art, is on trial because of her collaboration with the Marquis de Sade. Heads will roll unless the independent fan-maker, erotically cast in the shadow of Sade, can justify her art and friendships to a court known for its rigid and prudish proprieties. . . ."Startling and evocative . . .

The beautiful Duchess, reputedly immortalized in Goya's renowned pair of paintings of the unnamed Maja, the naked and the clothed, was notorious for her flamboyant independence and had her enemies. So did she die of a sudden fever or was it suicide provoked by the rapid fading of her beauty and an ennui accelerated by addiction to the "powder of the Andes" and unappeased by a string of amours and a risky dabbling in palace intrigue? Or was she poisoned, as Madrid gossip would have it, at the instigation of her arch-rival the Queen, Maria Luisa? Larreta's account, in Carmell's smooth translation, is purportedly the recently discovered secret memoir of de Godoy, First Minister of Spain at the time of the Duchess's death in 1802, which, written years later, recounts, erstwhile lovers both, Godoy's and Goya's differing understandings of that fateful occasion. Ultimately, pleasurable as it is, the work disappoints, for the characters are insufficiently well rounded to evoke much sympathy, and the device of encapsulating commentaries within commentaries does not compensate for thinness of narrative line.

From classical antiquity through the Enlightenment, the monstrous child bore witness to the fearsome power of the mother's imagination. What such a notion meant and how it reappeared, transformed, in the Romantic period are the questions explored in this book, a fascinating study of theories linking imagination, art, and monstrous progeny.</p><p>Down through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, philosophers and men of science rendered their learned opinions on the power of the female imagination to dominate, and thus distort, the act of procreation. Drawing on biological and physiological texts from classical times through the nineteenth century, Marie-H�l�ne Huet presents this argument as it evolved and as it reflected doubts about the force of paternity. She shows how, in the late eighteenth century, the discussion shifted from the scientific sphere to the aesthetic, and how the idea of imagination as monstrous progenitor eventually became a Romantic conceit. In reinterpreting art as teratology, however, Romanticism reclaimed the subversive power of imagination as a masculine attribute; it was now the artist as monstrous father who would generate new forms. From Ambroise Pare to Diderot, from Shelley to Hawthorne, Balzac and Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, as Huet demonstrates, the monster and the work of art challenged preconceived ideas of the natural order of things&#x2015;and disclosed, for all to see, the silent desire of their makers: to procreate without the other.</p><p>In this analysis of monstrous genesis Huet examines anew such questions as the authorship of <i>Frankenstein</i>, the birth of the Tussaud wax museum, and the ancient legend of the golem. Bringing together philosophy and science, aesthetics and popular culture, <i>Monstrous Imagination</i> is a marvel of intellectual history&#x2015;a remarkable account of how the imagination has manifested itself, above all, in theory.</p></p><p></p><h2>Emil and the Detectives</h2><p>If Mrs Tischbein had known the amazing adventures her son Emil would have in Berlin, she&#39;d never have let him go. Unfortunately, when his seven pounds goes missing on the train, Emil is determined to get it back - and when he teams up with the detectives he meets in Berlin, it&#39;s just the start of a marvellous money-retrieving adventure . . . A classic and influential story, Emil and the Detectives remains an enthralling read. From November 16th 2013, an exciting new adaptation of Emil and the Detectives will be playing at the National Theatre in London.</p><p>Erich Kastner was born in Dresden in 1899, the son of a saddle maker and a maidservant. He was drafted into the army in 1917, and his experiences there were to influence his later pacifism. He published Emil and the Detectives in 1928 to great success. A sequel, Emil and the Three Twins, appeared in 1933, but soon afterwards his books were labelled &#34;contrary to the German spirit&#34; and burned in public by the Nazis. He was interviewed by the Gestapo several times, but remained in Berlin until 1945, when he fled the city to avoid the Soviet assault. After the war he continued to write and remained committed to anti-war movements until his death in 1974.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Mrs. Harris: The Death of the Scarsdale Diet Doctor</h2><p>Provides a detailed look at the Herman Tarnower murder trial and the former headmistress convicted of that crime</p><p></p><h2>Western Civilization: Their History and Their Culture, 8th Edition</h2><p>In many companies knowledge management has focused almost exclusively upon the packaging of existing knowledge.

Now&nbsp;&nbsp;the scent of the stuff has brought every dreamer,&nbsp;&nbsp;drifter, and two-bit swindler to town.

Sheriff&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave Buckalew is a man too proud to give up and&nbsp;&nbsp;too stubborn to give in. He liked his town the way&nbsp;&nbsp;it was--before the bootleggers, brothels, and&nbsp;&nbsp;fortune-seeking roustabouts--and so did a lot of other&nbsp;&nbsp;hardworking decent folk. Together they'll fight&nbsp;&nbsp;to win back their town--and their future. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;the story of their heroic stand.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Elmer Kelton is the author of almost forty novels and has won awards from the Western Writers of America, the Texas Institute of Letters, and the Western Literature Association.

Inhabiting Caprock, a place where people say, "If you aint's et, I'd be tickled to have your company," are, conveniently, the good guys: Slim McIntyre, the newly arrived, wide-eyed farm boy; Tracy Whitmore, the waitress Slim's courtin'; Dave Buckalew, the earnest sheriff who yearns for the pre-boom days; Choctaw, the brave but pithy Indian; Jolene, the straight-talkin', maternal madam; and Victor Underwood, the educated young speculator. Soon after Slim arrives, the bad guys--Big Boy Daugherty and his gangsters Turk, Irish, French and Sarge--start terrorizing the town. Despite Buckalew's efforts, no one will speak out against Daugherty, until Lydia, a prostitute, admits she saw a murder. Buckalew puts her in his witness protection program (his vacant ranch house), and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Slim and Choctaw help the nearly bankrupt Underwood drill his last-chance well. The novel's conclusion is as subtle as an oncoming train. With 19 novels to his credit, Kelton obviously has found an audience. Here he makes no higher claim than to portray a boom town, but even for that standard, Honor at Daybreak has too much hokum, too few surprises. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sailor Moon 6</h2><p>With an intense bombardment of continuous attacks by the Black Moon, the Scouts are pushed to the edge with little chance of survival.</p><p></p><h2>Common Bonds: Stories by and about Modern Texas Women (Southwest Life and Letters)</h2><p>Common Bonds: Stories by and about Modern Texas Women (Southwest Life and Letters)</p><p></p><h2>The Problem of Wealth: A Christian Response to a Culture of Affluence</h2><p>What if we reconsidered our views on poverty and perceived it as a problem with the way we live with wealth?

Folded into this small package are compact views on resourcefulness, momentum, cunning, the profit motive, flexibility, integrity, secrecy, speed, positioning, surprise, deception, manipulation, responsibility, and practicality. Thomas Cleary's translation keeps the package tight, with crisp language and short sections. Commentaries from the Chinese tradition trail Sun-tzu's words, elaborating and picking up on puzzling lines. Take the solitary passage: "Do not eat food for their soldiers." Elsewhere, Sun-tzu has told us to plunder the enemy's stores, but now we're not supposed to eat the food? The Tang dynasty commentator Du Mu solves the puzzle nicely, "If the enemy suddenly abandons their food supplies, they should be tested first before eating, lest they be poisoned." Most passages, however, are the pinnacle of succinct clarity: "Lure them in with the prospect of gain, take them by confusion" or "Invincibility is in oneself, vulnerability is in the opponent." Sun-tzu's maxims are widely applicable beyond the military because they speak directly to the exigencies of survival. Your new tools will serve you well, but don't flaunt them. Remember Sun-tzu's advice: "Though effective, appear to be ineffective." <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war.

Maxwell's first fiction since the novel So Long, See You Tomorrow (American Book Award, 1980). Nothing that Maxwell touches upon in these far-back reminiscences is ever bruised or forced as the author, again and again, patiently and delicately draws forth moments of recognition and quiet epiphany from the distant past. ``Billie Dyer'' is the historian-author's tale of a black man from a poor family in turn- of-the-century Lincoln, Illinois, who went on to become an influential medical doctor. Himself born in Lincoln in 1908, Maxwell can devote four pages to the death of a beloved fifth-grade teacher (``Love'') without the faintest whisper of sentimentality, and in another five pages find a life's-worth of self-recognition in a simple childhood moment of moral failure (``With Reference to an Incident at a Bridge''). Longer pieces roam into their material and bring alive the daily life of a lost century, as in a story of a ne'er-do-well uncle (``The Man in the Moon''); through subtle biographies of townspeople told on the occasion of a death (``My Father's Friends''); in a study of race, class, and family history (``The Front and the Back Parts of the House''); or in the passionately quiet tale of a brother losing a leg in a childhood accident (``The Holy Terror''). ``As the details unfolded before my mind,'' writes Maxwell at one point, ``I went on putting them down, trusting that there was a story and that I would eventually find it.'' He finds it again and again, with delicacy, intelligence, and piercing beauty, in fiction that draws stories forth from the reality of life instead of imposing them on it. Treasurable small masterworks of American literature. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Maxwell's essays, novels ( So Long, See You Tomorrow ) and stories have always been models of meticulous, unpretentious, crystal-clear language, and in the seven beautiful tales in this collection he again enriches his graceful prose with affecting candor and poignancy. As before, the experiences rendered here might be classed as memoirs, being reminiscences of real people in Maxwell's life, and fictional re-creations of what was or what might have been. They are pervaded by a recurrent theme: that is is impossible to recapture--or even to know--the past; and they convey a picture of a certain time and place: the small town of Lincoln, Ill., around the turn of the century, when Maxwell was young (he was born in 1908). The subject of race relations in a genteelly prejudiced community is evoked with delicacy in tales that deal with members of the black Dyer family. In the title story, Billie Dyer's life is testimony to his quiet determination to serve his people as a doctor; his sister Hattie, in "The Front and the Back of the House," causes the narrator to realize that he has unwittingly destroyed her dignity. A sense of loss is also pervasive: the death of the narrator's mother when he was a boy; that of his father years later; and now, a cri de coeur: "The view after 70 is breathtaking. What is lacking is someone, anyone , of the older generation to whom you can turn when you want to satisfy your curiosity about some detail of the landscape of the past." In Maxwell's hands, these details are rendered with haunting immediacy. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Musical World Of Halim El-Dabh</h2><p><strong>Biography of an important figure in 20th-century musical history</strong> <p></p> <p>Egyptian-born composer Halim El-Dabh has studied with the giants of 20th-centruy musical composition and conducting.

The Seattle strangling murder of Alpine native Carol Stokes is generating headlines, but the accused killer is Emma&#39;s long-lost cousin Ronnie, who swears he was out drinking when his girlfriend was strangled. But he can&#39;t prove it, and neighbors claim they heard the couple fighting moments before the murder. Now Emma and supersnoop Vida, the Advocate&#39;s house-and-home editor, must find another suspect. Someone who hated Carol enough to write a tragic ending to her life story. Someone who is preparing to edit Emma and Vida right out of existence. . . .</p><p><b>Mary Richardson Daheim</b>&nbsp;started spinning stories before she could spell. Daheim has been a journalist, an editor, a public relations consultant, and a freelance writer, but fiction was always her medium of choice. In 1982, she launched a career that is now distinguished by more than sixty novels. In 2000, she won the Literary Achievement Award from the Pacific Northwest Writers Association. In October 2008, she was inducted into the University of Washington&#x2019;s Communication Alumni Hall of Fame. Daheim lives in her hometown of Seattle and is a direct descendant of former residents of the real Alpine, which existed as a logging town from 1910 to 1929, when it was abandoned after the mill was closed. The Alpine/Emma Lord series has created interest in the site, which was named a Washington State ghost town in July 2011. An organization called the Alpine Advocates has been formed to preserve what remains of the town as a historic site.The last time I saw my cousin Ronnie, he was half of a sack race at a<br>family picnic. He was a clumsy kid, and the leg that was tied to my<br>brother, Ben, managed to trip them both, so that they finished dead last.<br>I never imagined that the next time I saw Ronnie he'd be in the King<br>County Jail on a homicide charge.<br>The Ronnie Mallett I remembered from the gathering at Seattle's Woodland<br>Park was nine or ten, an undersized, unremarkable boy except for his<br>cheerful disposition. I'd been entering my junior year at the University<br>of Washington and felt the natural superiority that comes from age and the<br>use of good grammar. Maybe that's the thing I remembered best about<br>Ronnie: He said ain't <br>a lot.<br>"I ain't guilty, Emma," Ronnie said now, his thin face wearing an earnest<br>expression that didn't quite suit him. "Hey, why would I kill Carol? I was<br>nuts about her."<br>Carol Stokes was his girlfriend, a thirty-four-year-old woman who had been<br>found strangled in the living room of her one-bedroom apartment in<br>Seattle's Greenwood district. Obviously, I was supposed to say something<br>reassuring, such as, "Of course, you didn't, Ronnie."<br>But I couldn't and didn't. I hadn't seen my cousin in over twenty-five<br>years. For all I knew, he could be a serial killer.<br>"I'm not sure I can be of much help," I said, substituting candor for<br>comfort. "I'm not exactly sure why you asked me to come down from Alpine<br>to see you here."<br>Ronnie's knuckles whitened as he gripped edge of the table that separated<br>us. We weren't more than three feet away from each other, yet I felt the<br>distance might as well have been the eighty-plus miles between Alpine and<br>Seattle. The visitors' area was painted a pale blue, about the color of<br>Ronnie's eyes, and just about as lifeless. My chair was hard and<br>uncomfortable; so was Ronnie's, I supposed. The difference was that after<br>I stood up, I could leave the building.<br>"Like I said," Ronnie explained, "a coupla months ago Carol told me you<br>were some kind of detective. See, she was raised in Alpine, but moved out<br>when she was just a kid."<br>The original message I'd received from Ronnie's court-appointed lawyer two<br>days earlier had asked me to visit my cousin in jail because I was an<br>investigator. I was puzzled, since my job as editor and publisher of The<br>Alpine Advocate didn't seem to qualify.<br>"I'm not a detective," I said firmly. "I do some investigative reporting<br>for the weekly newspaper I own in Alpine."<br>"Carol said you caught a couple of killers," Ronnie said in an accusing<br>tone.<br>"Not exactly." An editor, a publisher, a reporter in a small town can get<br>caught up in a case when local law enforcement is hampered by size and<br>budget. Certainly in the ten years since I'd bought the paper, I'd helped<br>out with some homicide investigations. Digging for information was an<br>occupational necessity. But I was no sleuth. "Carol must have<br>misunderstood. My main job is to <br>report the stories after they happen."<br>Ronnie's lean face fell. I knew he was in his mid-<br>thirties, but he looked younger, if pinched and hollow-eyed. His dull<br>blond hair fell over his high forehead, his upper lip disappeared when he<br>smiled, and his eyebrows didn't quite match. Ronnie's overall appearance<br>was that of a very old little boy.<br>I could see no family resemblance. Ronnie was fair, while I was<br>dark-haired and dark-eyed. His narrow face with its ferretlike features<br>was the flip side of my softer, more rounded contours. Maybe one of us had<br>been a changeling.<br>"What'll I do?" Ronnie asked in a helpless voice.<br>"You've got a lawyer," I pointed out.<br>Ronnie shook his head. "He can't do me much good. Alvie's kinda young and<br>real busy."<br>On the phone, Alvin Sternoff had sounded as if he was straight out of law<br>school and maybe had finished in the bottom 10 percent of his class. He<br>hadn't offered much advice on how I could help Ronnie.<br>"What do you want me to do?" I asked my cousin, and immediately cursed the<br>soft heart that matched my even softer brain.<br>Ronnie leaned back in the plastic chair and gave me his guileless smile.<br>"Find out who really killed Carol," he said, " 'cause I ain't guilty."<br><br>"Do you believe him?" Vida Runkel asked the following Monday morning as I<br>stood in The Advocate's newsroom drinking coffee.<br>"I don't know," I said with a shake of my head. "The problem is, I don't<br>know Ronnie. The last time I saw him, he was just a kid, and I don't think<br>our families had gotten together more than four or five times before that.<br>My parents thought that his parents were--as my mother put it--'party<br>people.' I translated that as 'too dumb to be hippies.' "<br>"My, my," Vida said, setting down her mug of hot water and adjusting the<br>pinwheel straw hat that sat at a peculiar angle atop her unruly gray<br>curls. "And you say his girlfriend--the victim--came from Alpine?"<br>The local angle intrigued Vida more than Ronnie or the murder. My House<br>and Home editor is so thoroughly centered in the town of her birth that<br>occasionally she has trouble accepting events that happen elsewhere as<br>important or even real. Indeed, even World War II had been reduced in<br>Vida's mind to how she had traipsed along with her father on his<br>air-raid-warden duties and looked into the windows of those foolish enough<br>to leave the lights on and their shades pulled up. Snooping into other<br>people's homes was a habit that she had never outgrown.<br>"Yes. Carol Stokes. Don't tell me you know her?" I was aghast. Vida knew<br>everybody in Alpine, going back to the generations before her birth some<br>sixty-odd years ago.<br>She grimaced. "Honestly, I can't say that I do. Carol Stokes." She said<br>the name as if it were an incanta-<br>tion. "She must have left town at an early age and married. Carol Stokes,"<br>she repeated. "Carol . . . Carol . . . Carol . . ." Obviously, Vida was<br>reaching into the past, taking inventory of every Carol who had walked<br>Alpine's steep streets on the face of Tonga Ridge. "Ah," she exclaimed at<br>last, "Carol Nerstad! Now I remember!" Her broad face beamed in triumph.<br>"Nerstad?" The name was unfamiliar.<br>Vida nodded, the straw hat swaying dangerously. "Her parents died quite<br>young, and Carol's brother, Teddy, moved to California. Burl, the father,<br>was killed in the woods, and Marvela, the mother, had cancer. A shame, of<br>course, though they were a bit odd."<br>I refrained from asking Vida how odd. In her critical mind, the word could<br>have described a penchant for putting gravy on gingerbread or having a<br>physical relationship with the family pet.<br>"Goodness," Vida mused, "that must have been almost twenty years ago. As I<br>recall, Carol left town under a cloud, as we used to say."<br>My ad manager, Leo Walsh, turned away from his computer screen. "You mean<br>she got knocked up?"<br>Vida scowled at Leo. "Mind your language. Yes, I believe she was pregnant.<br>One of the Erickson boys. Or was it a Tolberg?" She stopped and stared at<br>me through her red-framed glasses. "Carol Nerstad was murdered? Heavens,<br>that's a page one story! Why didn't you say so, Emma?"<br>My family problem had finally landed in Vida's lap. "Because I didn't know<br>Carol was from here until I saw Ronnie when I was in Seattle over the<br>weekend. Yes, it is a story for The Advocate, even though the actual<br>murder happened a couple of weeks ago."<br>Vida was agog. "What about services? Where was Carol buried? Who handled<br>the arrangements?" She slapped at her visitors' chair. "Do sit and stop<br>prowling around like a cat on a griddle. "Why didn't we get a notice from<br>the funeral home in Seattle?"<br>With a sigh, I sat down next to Vida's desk. "I haven't any idea about the<br>burial. You know perfectly well that we don't always get alerted when a<br>former resident dies. If my cousin had anything to do with it, he probably<br>didn't even mention where Carol was born. I'm not sure he knows where he<br>was born."<br>"But you do," Vida said, looking as if she was about to pounce on me.<br>"Yes, he was born in Seattle." I stared at Vida. "So what?"<br>"Family. Kin. Ties. Really, Emma," she said in reproach, "except for your<br>parents and your brother, Ben, you don't speak much about your relatives.<br>Frankly, I've always found that odd."<br>Leo chuckled. "I find it a damned good thing. The trouble with you,<br>Duchess," he went on, using the nickname Vida despised, "you've got so<br>many relatives and in-laws and shirttail relations that nobody can keep<br>them straight."<br>"I can," Vida snapped. "One of the things that's wrong with this world is<br>that families don't keep up with each other. They move here, there, and<br>everywhere like a bunch of nomads. What are they looking for? Trouble,<br>mostly. If Carol Nerstad had stayed in Alpine, she probably wouldn't have<br>gotten herself murdered. Now," she continued, her voice quieting, "tell me<br>what happened, Emma."<br>"I would if I could get a--"<br>" 'Morning, all," said a deep voice from the doorway as Scott Chamoud<br>arrived, late as usual. "What's up?"<br>"The Duchess's dander," Leo replied. "Thanks for joining us, Scotty. We're<br>having a staff meeting."<br>My young reporter's limpid brown eyes grew wide. "We are? Did I forget?"<br>"No," I managed to get in, "you didn't. Leo's kidding. But," I added with<br>a meaningful glance at my watch, "you're late. It's almost eight-thirty."<br>Scott waved a white paper bag he'd been hiding behind his back. "I know.<br>It was my turn to stop at the Upper Crust Bakery. Anyone for fresh<br>doughnuts and some cinnamon twists?"<br>It was hard to get mad at Scott. He was not only a good writer, but<br>handsome as hell. I didn't bother to remind him that he would have been<br>late with or without the bakery stop.<br>"I'll take a twist," I said, holding out my hand. Vida, who is always<br>dieting to no perceptible effect, staunchly shook her head. Leo snagged a<br>couple of doughnuts before Scott sat down behind his desk.<br>"Okay," I said, taking a deep breath, then glancing at Scott. "I'm filling<br>everyone in--I guess--on the recent murder in Seattle of a young woman who<br>grew up in Alpine and 'left under a cloud.' "<br>"Pregnant?" Scott asked.</p><h2>The collected greed, parts 1-13</h2><p>First edition. Printed by Graham Mackintosh &amp; Edwards Brothers Inc. and designed by Barbara Martin.

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Rhannon Hills. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was <i>a</i> beginning.<br>Born among the groves and vineyards that covered much of the rugged hills, the olive trees in evergreen rows, the ordered vines leafless till spring, the cold wind blew west and north across the prosperous farms dotting the land between the hills and the great harbor of Ebou Dar. The land lay winter fallow still, but men and women were already oiling plowshares and tending harnesses, preparing for the planting to come. They paid little mind to the trains of heavily laden wagons moving east along the dirt roads carrying people who wore odd clothes and spoke with odd accents. Many of the strangers seemed to be farmers themselves, familiar implements lashed to their wagon boxes, and in their wagons unfamiliar saplings with roots balled in rough cloth, but they were heading on toward more distant land. Nothing to do with life here and now. The Seanchan hand lay lightly on those who did not contest Seanchan rule, and the farmers of the Rhannon Hills had seen no changes in their lives. For them, rain or the lack of it had always been the true ruler.<br>West and north the wind blew, across the broad blue-green expanse of the harbor, where hundreds of huge ships sat rocking at anchor on choppy swells, some bluff-bowed and rigged with ribbed sails, others long and sharp-prowed, with men laboring to match their sails and rigging to those of the wider vessels. Not nearly so many ships still floated there as had only a few days before, though. Many now lay in the shallows, charred wrecks heeled over on their sides, and burned frames settling in the deep gray mud like blackened skeletons. Smaller craft skittered about the harbor, slanting under triangular sails or crawling on oars like many-legged waterbugs, most carrying workers and supplies to the ships that still floated. Other small vessels and barges rode tethered to what appeared to be tree trunks shorn of branches, rising out of the blue-green water, and from those men dove holding stones to carry them down swiftly to sunken ships below, where they tied ropes to whatever could be hauled up for salvage. Six nights ago death had walked across the water here, the One Power killing men and women and ships in darkness split by silver lightnings and hurtling balls of fires. Now the rough rolling harbor, filled with furious activity, seemed at peace by comparison, the chop giving up spray to the wind that blew north and west across the mouth of the River Eldar, where it widened into the harbor, north and west and inland.<br>Sitting cross-legged atop a boulder covered with brown moss, on the reed-fringed bank of the river, Mat hunched his shoulders against the wind and cursed silently. There was no gold to be found here, no women or dancing, no fun. Plenty of discomfort, though. In short, it was the last sort of place he would choose, normally. The sun stood barely its own height above the horizon, the sky overhead was pale slate gray, and thick purple clouds moving in from the sea threatened rain. Winter hardly seemed winter without snow--he had yet to see a single flake in Ebou Dar--but a cold damp morning wind off the water could serve as well as snow to chill a man to the bone. Six nights since he had ridden out of the city in a storm, yet his throbbing hip seemed to think he was still soaked to the skin and clinging to a saddle. This was no weather or time of day for a man to be out by his own choice. He wished he had thought to bring a cloak. He wished he had stayed in bed.<br>Ripples in the land hid Ebou Dar, just over a mile to the south, and hid him from the city, as well, but there was not a tree or anything more than scrub brush in sight. Being in the open this way made him feel as though ants were crawling under his skin. He should be safe, though. His plain brown woolen coat and cap were nothing like the clothes he was known by in the city. Instead of black silk, a drab woolen scarf hid the scar around his neck, and the collar of his coat was turned up to hide that, as well. Not a bit of lace or a thread of embroidery. Dull enough for a farmer milking cows. No one he needed to avoid would know him to recognize if they saw him. Not unless they were close. Just the same, he tugged the cap a bit lower.<br>"You intend to stay out here much longer, Mat?" Noal's tattered dark blue coat had seen better days, but then so had he. Stooped and white-haired, the broken-nosed old fellow was squatting on his heels below the boulder, fishing off the riverbank with a bamboo pole. Most of his teeth were missing, and sometimes he felt at a gap with his tongue as though surprised to find the empty space. "It's cold, in case you haven't noticed. Everybody always thinks it's warm in Ebou Dar, but winter is cold everywhere, even places that make Ebou Dar feel like Shienar. My bones crave a fire. Or a blanket, anyway. A man can be snug with a blanket, if he's out of the wind. Are you going to do anything but stare downriver?"<br>When Mat only glanced at him, Noal shrugged and went back to peering at the tarred wooden float bobbing among the sparse reeds. Now and then he worked one gnarled hand as though his crooked fingers felt the chill particularly, but if so, it was his own fault. The old fool had gone wading in the shallows to scoop up minnows for bait with a basket that now sat half-submerged and anchored by a smooth stone at the edge of the water. Despite his complaints about the weather, Noal had come along to the river without urging or invitation. From things he had said, everyone he cared about was long years dead, and the truth of it was, he seemed almost desperate for any sort of company. Desperate, indeed, to choose Mat's company when he could be five days from Ebou Dar by now. A man could cover a lot of ground in five days if he had reason to and a good horse. Mat had thought on that very subject often enough himself.<br>On the far side of the Eldar, half-hidden by one of the marshy islands that dotted the river, a broad-beamed rowboat backed oars, and one of the crew stood up and fished in the reeds with a long boathook. Another oarsman helped him heave what he had caught into the boat. At this distance, it looked like a large sack. Mat winced and shifted his eyes downriver. They were still finding bodies, and he was responsible. The innocent died along with the guilty. And if you did nothing, then only the innocent died. Or as bad as died. Maybe worse than, depending on how you looked at it.<br>He scowled irritably. Blood and ashes, he was turning into a bloody philosopher! Taking responsibility drained all the joy out of life and dried a man to dust. What he wanted right then was a great deal of mulled wine in a snug common room full of music, and a plump, pretty serving maid on his knee, somewhere far from Ebou Dar. Very far. What he had were obligations he could not walk away from and a future he did not fancy. There seemed no help at all in being <i>ta'veren</i>, not if this was how the Pattern shaped itself to you. He still had his luck, anyway. At least, he was alive and not chained in a cell. Under the circumstances, that counted as luck.<br>From his perch, he had a fairly clear view down past the last low marshy river islands. Wind-caught spray drifted up the harbor like banks of fine mist, but not enough to hide what he needed to see. He was attempting to do sums in his head, counting ships afloat, trying to count wrecks. He kept losing his place, though, thinking he had counted vessels twice and starting over. The Sea Folk who had been recaptured intruded on his thoughts, too. He had heard that gibbets in the Rahad, across the harbor, displayed more than a hundred corpses, with placards listing "murder" and "rebellion" as their crimes. Normally, the Seanchan used the headsman's axe and the impaling stake, while the Blood got the strangling cord, but property had to settle for being hanged.<br><i>Burn me, I did what I could</i>, he thought sourly. There was no use feeling guilty that that was all he could do. Not a bit of use, None! He had to concentrate on the people who escaped.<br>The Atha'an Miere who got away had taken ships in the harbor for their flight, and while they might have seized some smaller craft, anything they could board and overwhelm in the night, they had intended to carry off as many of their people as possible. With thousands of them laboring as prisoners in the Rahad, that would have meant big ships, by choice, and that meant Seanchan greatships. Many of the Sea Folk's own vessels were large enough, for certain, but they all had been stripped of their sails and rigging by that time, to be fitted out in the Seanchan fashion. If he could calculate how many greatships remained, he might have some notion of how many Atha'an Miere had actually reached freedom. Freeing the Sea Folk Windfinders had been the right thing to do, the only thing he could do, but aside from the hangings, hundreds and hundreds of bodies had been fished out of the harbor in the last five days, and the Light only knew how many had washed out to sea with the tides. The gravediggers labored from sunup to sundown, and the graveyards were filled with weeping women and children. Men, too. More than a few of those dead had been Atha'an Miere, with no one to weep while they were dumped into mass graves, and he wanted some idea of the number he had saved to balance his bleak suspicions of the number he had killed.<br>Estimating how many ships had made it out into the Sea of Storms was difficult, though, quite apart from losing the count. Unlike Aes Sedai, Windfinders had no strictures against using the Power as a weapon, not when the safety of their people was at stake, and they would have...</p><h2>Things To Make &amp; Do In Fourth Dimension</h2><p>Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension<br>A guide to exploring the world of maths. Starting with simple numbers and algebra, it goes on to deal with inconceivably big numbers in more dimensions than you ever knew existed.<br></p><p>Originally a maths teacher from Australia, Matt Parker now lives in Godalming in a house full of almost every retro video-game console ever made. He is fluent in binary and could write your name in a sequence of noughts and ones in seconds. He loves doing maths and stand-up, often simultaneously. When he&#39;s not working as the Public Engagement in Mathematics Fellow at Queen Mary University of London, he&#39;s performing in sold-out live comedy shows, spreading his love of maths via TV and radio, or converting photographs into Excel spreadsheets. He is the author of Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension.Gr 8 Up&#x2014;For readers who haven't balked at Stephen Hawkings's A Brief History of Time (Bantam, 1988) or Robert P. Crease and Alfred Scharff Goldhaber's The Quantum Moment (Norton, 2014), this sustained ramble through the thickets of mathematics offers similarly lucid but challenging insights into our universe's deeper patterns and principles. Building not on a chronological but a conceptual framework outlined in the opening chapter, "Zeroth Chapter," the author explores the historical evolution of mathematical tools, conjectures, and concepts from numbers and geometrical shapes to primes, knots, algorithms, multiple dimensions, computers from the Antikythera Mechanism on, probability, "ridiculous" (i.e., negative, transcendental, surreal, and the like) numbers, and infinities of diverse flavor. He adds lots of small diagrams and photos to illustrate his topics, but appends no index or, aside from follow-up comments on scattered posers, back matter. A stand-up comedian as well as a trained mathematician, Parker lightens the intellectual load considerably with zingers ("That's the problem with binary jokes: they either work or they don't") and everyday examples from bar bets to dating algorithms. Still, even confirmed math geeks will find this pleasurable but not casual reading.&#x2014;John Peters, Children's Literature Consultant, New York City</p><h2>Poppy and Sam&#39;s Wipe-Clean Christmas Activities (Farmyard Tales Poppy and Sam)</h2><p>Join Poppy and Sam at Christmas for a mixture of simple, fun wipe-clean activities for young children.

And now pretty Alice Cottrell, Fairborn's one-time paramour, wants the bookselling, book-loving burglar to break into a room in New York's teeth-achingly charming Paddington Hotel and purloin some of the writer's very personal letters before an unscrupulous agent can sell them. Here's an opportunity to use his unique talents in the service of the revered, famously reclusive author. But when Bernie gets there, the agent is dead . . . and Bernie's wanted for murder. (He <em>really</em> hates when that happens!)</p><p>Perhaps it's karmic payback; Bernie <em>did</em> help himself to a ruby necklace on his way out. (But it <em>was</em> lying there. And he <em>is</em> a burglar.) Now he's in even hotter water. And he'll need to use every trick in the book&#x2014;maybe going so far as to entice the hermitic Fairborn himself out of seclusion&#x2014;to bring this increasingly twisted plot to a satisfying denouement.</p></p><p>Lawrence Block is such a gifted writer that even a native New Yorker will be fooled into thinking that the Paddington Hotel, described in the opening pages of <i>Burglar in the Rye</i>, is a real institution. Block's descriptions of this enclave of artists, writers, and rock musicians is thoroughly convincing--although in actuality, the Paddington is a combination of the real-life Chelsea Hotel and Block's outrageous imagination.<p> This is Bernie Rhodenbarr's ninth heist. Bernie is a gentleman burglar who runs a used bookstore in between criminal acts, steals mostly from the rich, and only hurts people when it becomes <i>absolutely</i> necessary.</p><p> The Paddington is where Bernie goes to liberate the letters of a reclusive writer named Gulliver Fairborn from a literary agent. Fairborn's resemblance to J.D. Salinger and, of course, the fact that the woman who hired Bernie to steal the letters had an affair with Fairborn when she was a teenager, no doubt lend the book its title. But by the time Bernie gets to the Paddington, the agent has been shot, the letters already liberated--and a cop in the lobby recognizes our favorite burglar from a previous encounter. </p><p> Now all Bernie has to do is find out who else wanted those letters badly enough to kill for them. In typical Rhodenbarr tradition, the plot is less interesting than the trappings: the books Bernie reads, the fascinating objects he picks up along the way. The reader also learns about some mind-expanding facts, such as the existence of a tiny South American fish that swims up a man's urine stream and lodges in his private parts! Or did Block make that up, too?</p><p> Other Bernie picks include: <i>The Burglar in the Closet</i>, <i>The Burglar in the Library</i>, <i>The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling</i>, and <i>The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Bernie Rhodenbarr, bookseller by day, burglar by night, is on the prowl again. Pretty Alice Cottrell has hired him to infiltrate the crumbling old Paddington Hotel and steal back the letters of reclusive author Gulliver Fairborn from his once-upon-a-time agent, who now wishes to sell them at auction. Seems like an easy enough job, until Bernie discovers the letters missing -- and the agent dead in her bed. With the police only footsteps behind him, Bernie's got to make a fast escape or take the rap for a murder he didn't commit.<p>Only then does Bernie begin to wonder if he's been set up by a criminal -- one who is almost as clever as he is.</p></p><h2>The Observer&#39;s Book of Birds&#39; Eggs</h2><p>Book by COMPLIED BY G EVANS</p><p></p><h2>Problems With Atonement: The Origins of, and Controversy about, the Atonement Doctrine</h2><p><p>The origins of atonement are found in Paul's writings.

The three men encountered one another during the early twentieth century in Paris, then a cauldron of avant-garde activity in which Matisse was playing a vital role. Although they did not spend all that much time together -- a total, as far as we know, of around four and a half months -- these meetings resulted in a creative surge that had a powerful impact on the conventional Canadian art milieu of the time. When John Lyman exhibited his paintings in Montreal in 1913, they caused a scandal. Their bold new look reflected an aesthetic language shaped by lessons learned in Paris, notably at the Acad�mie Matisse in 1910. This critical event was the catalyst for an irreversible move forward that would be manifested over the next three decades in the formation of a variety of artists' associations dedicated to a modern, universal creative approach, free of any nationalist or regionalist ambition. These collectives included the Beaver Hall Group, the Atelier, the Contemporary Arts Society of Montreal, the artists linked to Alfred Pellan and the Prisme d'Yeux manifesto, and of course Paul-�mile Borduas and the Automatistes, source of the highly critical <i>Refus global</i>, which became a crucial factor in the Quiet Revolution that would transform Quebec during the 1960s.</p> <p>It was admittedly a bold move to bring together three men whose paths were so different, particularly since they left relatively little contemporary written evidence of their meetings. In the case of James Wilson Morrice, the only direct proof we have that he knew Matisse takes the form of two notes in a sketchbook dating from 1920-1922 that mention his name. But then Morrice left just as few clues to his encounters with his compatriot Lyman. Henri Matisse, on the other hand, was more communicative about Morrice. In letters to his wife, Am�lie, he mentions on several occasions having spent time with him in Tangier in April 1912. A few months after the Canadian's death, Matisse recalled their two trips to Morocco during the winters of 1912 and 1913: "You know the artist with the delicate eye who delighted in interpreting landscapes of closely related values in soft and muted hues. As a man, he was a true gentleman, a good companion, with great wit and humour." These lines by the French artist, published in the catalogue of the posthumous Morrice exhibition organized by the Galeries Simonson in Paris, in January 1926, have been invoked regularly by specialists, biographers, critics, art historians and museologists interested in the Montreal painter. Matisse's affection for him was confirmed on other occasions and documented by Morrice's biographer, Donald W. Buchanan, who interviewed Matisse twice to discuss their relationship. And in a letter to the curator of the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the Art Gallery of Ontario), Pierre Matisse, the artist's son, affirmed that the Canadian was "a very good friend" of his father.</p> <p>Of the three artists, it is John Lyman whose writings are the most illuminating. Although the painter made little mention of the Acad�mie Matisse in the letters written to his father while he was there, he defended his former teacher vigorously in 1913 when Montreal Journalists criticized his work, claiming it had been corrupted by Matisse's teaching and influence. In the diary Lyman kept from 1927 to 1963 and in the articles he published in <i>The Montrealer</i> between 1936 and 1942, he acknowledged his debt to C�zanne and Matisse and declared his admiration for Morrice, whose work he helped promote with his 1945 monograph on the painter -- the first ever in French. But the two richest sources of aesthetic, factual and anecdotal information concerning Lyman's relations with Matisse and Morrice are probably the documentary <i>John Lyman, peintre</i> produced by the National Film Board of Canada in 1959, and the handwritten notes by Guy Viau in which he recorded his memories of the painter. All this documentation attracted the attention of art historians, and several monographic studies of the two Canadians would appear, accompanied in 1985 and 1986 by retrospective exhibitions.</p> <p>But aside from the material research into the connections between the three painters it was above all their art that showed us the direction our project should take. Were Morrice and Lyman working as the disciples of a master, or were we dealing with an aesthetic kinship between three distinct personalities? The answer lies in the absolute freedom manifested in the production of the two Montreal painters. If there was a single principle that Henri Matisse held dear, it was the idea of creative authenticity, the need for artists to define their own path, regardless of institutional or commercial considerations. The interweaving of art and life was the basis of the liberty expressed by these three artists and of their capacity to appreciate the present moment.</p> <p>So as we follow the careers of Morrice, Lyman and Matisse, it is a narrative of artistic fraternity that emerges -- one composed of life stories and travelogues, and of aesthetic explorations spanning over eighty years, conducted in Canada and abroad. Morrice and Lyman's encounters with Matisse, though referred to in articles and specialized studies, had not hitherto been taken beyond the level of human interest and anecdote, and the data remained scattered and fragmented. Now, at last, the three artists have been brought together in an exhibition and a catalogue that offer a far more complete picture of a fundamental episode in the history of Canadian art.</p> <p>We have concentrated on the paintings, reluctantly leaving aside the many works on paper-drawings and water colours -- that would have further supported our argument. More specifically, we have focused on the three painters' shared view of "colour-light" as the expression of an aesthetic approach aimed at essential form, form that -- as Lyman (echoing Matisse) wrote -- is "below the surface, beyond appearances . . . permanent and durable."</p> <p>This catalogue testifies to the interest our project has generated among seasoned art historians. Three of the six essays it includes offer an in-depth exploration of relations between two of the artists. In "Morrice and Lyman: The Light of Exile," for example, I have traced the careers of the two Canadian painters abroad. The emancipation and freedom they embodied proved richly instructive. The essay also examines the vitality of Paris and its Salons (in which the artists participated), their aesthetic discoveries and the critical reception afforded their work, in France and in Canada. Their practice of art, so closely connected to their moves and travels, takes us to the countries of North Africa and to the islands of the Caribbean.</p> <p>In an essay entitled "Morrice and Matisse: Bedfellows Under the Sign of Modernism," John O'Brian examines the personal relationship between the two artists, as well public reaction to their respective oeuvres. Author of <i>Ruthless Hedonism</i> (1999) a remarkable book on the American reception of Matisse's work, the art historian begins by reviewing the two painters' historiography. He then goes on to discuss their encounters in Tangier and elucidate their painting procedures, ending with a fascinating account of the acquisition of works by Matisse in Canada.</p> <p>With his contribution, "Lyman's Encounter with Matisse," Fran�ois-Marc Gagnon offers an illuminating view of the relationship between John Lyman and the Fauve aesthetic. He examines the time the Montreal painter spent at the Acad�mie Matisse and his visits to the Steins, as well as his meetings with Matisse in Nice. Having considered the impact of the French artist on Lyman's work as a critic, the author clarifies the distinction between the notions of the "picturesque" and the "pictorial," and explains by means of examples how they and the concept of the "decorative" relate to the two artists' wor</p></p><h2>The Venetian Betrayal: A Novel (Cotton Malone)</h2><p>In 323 B.C.E, having conquered Persia, Alexander the Great set his sights on Arabia, then suddenly succumbed to a strange fever.

Sharp, acrid, with a hint of sulfur. And something else. Sweet and sickening. <br><br>Like death. <br><br>He opened his eyes. <br><br>He lay prone on the floor, arms extended, palms to the hardwood, which he immediately noticed was sticky. <br><br>What happened? <br><br>He&#x2019;d attended the April gathering of the Danish Antiquarian Booksellers Society a few blocks west of his bookshop, near the gaiety of Tivoli. He liked the monthly meetings and this one had been no exception. A few drinks, some friends, and lots of book chatter. Tomorrow morning he&#x2019;d agreed to meet Cassiopeia Vitt. Her call yesterday to arrange the meeting had surprised him. He&#x2019;d not heard from her since Christmas, when she&#x2019;d spent a few days in Copenhagen. He&#x2019;d been cruising back home on his bicycle, enjoying the comfortable spring night, when he&#x2019;d decided to check out the unusual meeting location she&#x2019;d chosen, the Museum of Greco-Roman Culture&#x2013;a preparatory habit from his former profession. Cassiopeia rarely did anything on impulse, so a little advance preparation wasn&#x2019;t a bad idea. <br><br>He&#x2019;d found the address, which faced the Frederiksholms canal, and noticed a half-open door to the pitch-dark building&#x2013;a door that should normally be closed and alarmed. He&#x2019;d parked his bike. The least he could do was close the door and phone the police when he returned home. <br><br>But the last thing he remembered was grasping the doorknob. <br><br>He was now inside the museum. <br><br>In the ambient light that filtered in through two plate-glass windows, he saw a space decorated in typical Danish style&#x2013;a sleek mixture of steel, wood, glass, and aluminum. The right side of his head throbbed and he caressed a tender knot. <br><br>He shook the fog from his brain and stood. <br><br>He&#x2019;d visited this museum once and had been unimpressed with its collection of Greek and Roman artifacts. Just one of a hundred or more private collections throughout Copenhagen, their subject matter as varied as the city&#x2019;s population. <br><br>He steadied himself against a glass display case. His fingertips again came away sticky and smelly, with the same nauseating odor. <br><br>He noticed that his shirt and trousers were damp, as was his hair, face, and arms. Whatever covered the museum&#x2019;s interior coated him, too. <br><br>He stumbled toward the front entrance and tried the door. Locked. Double dead bolt. A key would be needed to open it from the inside. <br><br>He stared back into the interior. The ceiling soared thirty feet. A wood-and-chrome staircase led up to a second floor that dissolved into more darkness, the ground floor extending out beneath. <br><br>He found a light switch. Nothing. He lumbered over to a desk phone. No dial tone. <br><br>A noise disturbed the silence. Clicks and whines, like gears working. Coming from the second floor. <br>His training as a Justice Department agent cautioned him to keep quiet, but also urged him to investigate. <br><br>So he silently climbed the stairs. <br><br>The chrome banister was damp, as were each of the laminated risers. Fifteen steps up, more glass-and-chrome display cases dotted the hardwood floor. Marble reliefs and partial bronzes on pedestals loomed like ghosts. Movement caught his eye twenty feet away. An object rolling across the floor. Maybe two feet wide with rounded sides, pale in color, tight to the ground, like one of those robotic lawn mowers he&#x2019;d once seen advertised. When a display case or statue was encountered, the thing stopped, retreated, then darted in a different direction. A nozzle extended from its top and every few seconds a burst of aerosol spewed out. <br><br>He stepped close. <br><br>All movement stopped. As if it sensed his presence. The nozzle swung to face him. A cloud of mist soaked his pants. <br><br>What was this? <br><br>The machine seemed to lose interest and scooted deeper into the darkness, more odorous mist expelling along the way. He stared down over the railing to the ground floor and spotted another of the contraptions parked beside a display case. <br><br>Nothing about this seemed good. <br><br>He needed to leave. The stench was beginning to turn his stomach. <br><br>The machine ceased its roaming and he heard a new sound. <br><br>Two years ago, before his divorce, his retirement from the government, and his abrupt move to Copenhagen, when he&#x2019;d lived in Atlanta, he&#x2019;d spent a few hundred dollars on a stainless-steel grill. The unit came with a red button that, when pumped, sparked a gas flame. He recalled the sound the igniter made with each pump of the button. <br><br>The same clicking he heard right now. <br><br>Sparks flashed. <br><br>The floor burst to life, first sun yellow, then burnt orange, finally settling on pale blue as flames radiated outward, consuming the hardwood. Flames simultaneously roared up the walls. The temperature rose swiftly and he raised an arm to shield his face. The ceiling joined the conflagration, and in less than fifteen seconds the second floor was totally ablaze. <br><br>Overhead sprinklers sprang to life. <br><br>He partially retreated down the staircase and waited for the fire to be doused. <br><br>But he noticed something. <br><br>The water simply aggravated the flames. <br><br>The machine that started the disaster suddenly disintegrated in a muted flash, flames rolling out in all directions, like waves searching for shore. <br><br>A fireball drifted to the ceiling and seemed to be welcomed by the spraying water. Steam thickened the air, not with smoke but with a chemical that made his head spin. <br><br>He leaped down the stairs two at a time. Another swoosh racked the second floor. Followed by two more. Glass shattered. Something crashed. <br><br>He darted to the front of the building. <br><br>The other gizmo that had sat dormant sprang to life and started skirting the ground-floor display cases. <br>More aerosol spewed into the scorching air. <br><br>He needed to get out. But the locked front door opened to the inside. Metal frame, thick wood. No way to kick it open. He watched as fire eased down the staircase, consuming each riser, like the devil descending to greet him. Even the chrome was being devoured with a vengeance.<br> <br>His breaths became labored, thanks to the chemical fog and the rapidly vanishing oxygen. Surely someone would call the fire department, but they&#x2019;d be no help to him.

They are in museums all over the world, and are among the most admired paintings of our time. Yet nobody knows the extraordinarily dramatic story behind their creation. Telling that story is the brilliant historian, Ross King&#x2014;and in the process, he presents a compelling and original portrait of perhaps the most beloved artist in history.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As World War I exploded within hearing distance of his house at Giverny, Monet was facing his own personal crucible. In 1911, his adored wife, Alice, had died, plunging him into deep mourning at age 71. A year later he began going blind. Then, his eldest son, Jean, fell ill and died of syphilis, and his other son was sent to the front to fight for France. Within months, a violent storm destroyed much of the garden that had been his inspiration for some 20 years. At the same time, his reputation was under attack, as a new generation of artists, led by Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, were dazzling the art world and expressing disgust with Impressionism. Against all this, fighting his own self-doubt, depression and age, Monet found the wherewithal to construct a massive new studio, 70 feet long and 50 feet high, to accommodate the gigantic canvases that would, he hoped, revive him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using letters, memoirs and other sources not employed by other biographers, and focusing on this remarkable period in the artist's life, Ross King reveals a more complex, more human, more intimate Claude Monet than has ever been portrayed, and firmly places his water lily project among the greatest achievements in the history of art.</p><p>ROSS KING is the highly praised author of&nbsp;<i>The Judgment of Paris</i>,&nbsp;<i>Brunelleschi's Dome</i>,&nbsp;<i>Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling</i>,&nbsp;<i>Defiant Spirits: The Modernist Revolution of the Group of Seven</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Leonardo and the Last Supper</i>. He has twice won the Governor General's Award for Non-Fiction (for&nbsp;<i>The Judgment of Paris</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Leonardo and the Last Supper</i>). Born and raised in Canada, he holds degrees from the University of Regina, York University in Toronto and University College, London. He now lives near Oxford, England.Much of Claude Monet&#x2019;s life and work had been a mad striving for the impossible. His goal, which he frankly admitted was unattainable, was to paint his carefully chosen object&#x2014;the cathedral, cliff, or wheat stack before which he raised his easel&#x2014;under singular and fleeting conditions of weather and light. As he told an English visitor, he wanted &#x201c;to render my impressions before the most fugitive effects.&#x201d; In 1889 a critic had scoffed that Monet&#x2019;s paintings were nothing more than a matter of &#x201c;geography and the calendar.&#x201d; This was, however, to miss the point of Monet&#x2019;s work. Since objects changed their color and appearance according to the seasons, the meteorological conditions, and the time of day, Monet hoped to capture their visual impact in these brief, distinctive, ever-changing moments in time. He concentrated not&nbsp;only on the objects themselves but also, critically, on the atmosphere that surrounded them, the erratically shifting phantoms of light and color that he called the&nbsp;<i>enveloppe</i>. &#x201c;Everything changes, even stone,&#x201d; he wrote to Alice while working on his paintings of the fa�ade of Rouen&nbsp;Cathedral. But freezing the appearance of objects amid fleeting phantoms of light and air was no easy task. &#x201c;I am chasing a dream,&#x201d; he admitted in 1895. &#x201c;I want the impossible.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recording the fugitive effects of color and light was integral to Monet&#x2019;s art. Setting up his easel in front of Rouen Cathedral, or the wheat stacks in the frozen meadow outside Giverny, or the windswept cliffs at �tretat on the coast of Normandy, he would paint throughout the day as the light and weather, and finally the seasons, changed. To reproduce the desired effects accurately according to his personal sensations, he was forced to work outdoors, often in disagreeable conditions. In 1889 a journalist described him on the stormy beach beneath the cliffs at �tretat, &#x201c;dripping wet under his cloak, painting a hurricane in the salty spray&#x201d; as he tried to capture the different lighting conditions on two or three canvases that he shuttled back and forth onto his easel. Because lighting effects changed quickly&#x2014;every seven minutes, he once claimed&#x2014;he was forced, in his series paintings of wheat stacks and poplars, to work on multiple canvases almost simultaneously, placing a different one on his easel every seven minutes or so, rotating&nbsp;them according to the particular visual effect he was trying to capture. Clemenceau once watched him working in a poppy field with four different canvases. &#x201c;He was going from one to the other, according to the position of the sun.&#x201d; In the 1880s the writer Guy de Maupassant had likewise witnessed Monet &#x201c;in pursuit of impressions&#x201d; on the Normandy coast. He described how the painter was followed through the fields by his children and stepchildren &#x201c;carrying his canvases, five or six paintings depicting the same subject at different times and with different effects.&nbsp;He worked on them one by one, following all the changes in the sky.&#x201d; This obsession with capturing successive changes in the fall of light or the density of a fogbank could lead to episodes that were both comical (for observers) and infuriating (for Monet). In 1901, in London,&nbsp;he began painting what he called the &#x201c;unique atmosphere&#x201d; of the river Thames&#x2014;the famous pea-souper fogs&#x2014;from his room in the Savoy Hotel. Here he was visited by the painter John Singer Sargent, who found him surrounded by no fewer than ninety canvases, &#x201c;each one the record of a momentary effect of light over the Thames. When the effect was repeated and an opportunity occurred for finishing the picture,&#x201d; Sargent reported, &#x201c;the effect had generally passed away before the particular canvas could be found.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One irony of Monet&#x2019;s approach was that these paintings of fleeting visual effects at single moments in time actually took many months of work. &#x201c;I paint entirely out of doors,&#x201d; he once airily informed a journalist. &#x201c;I never touch my work in my studio.&#x201d; However, virtually all of Monet&#x2019;s canvases, although begun on the beaches or in the fields, were actually completed back in the studio, often far from the motif and with much teeth-gnashing labor. Octave Mirbeau reported that a single Monet canvas might take &#x201c;sixty sessions&#x201d; of work. Some of the canvases, moreover, were given fifteen layers of paint. His London paintings were finished not beside the banks of the Thames but as much as two years later in his studio in Giverny, beside the Seine, with the assistance of photographs. The revelation that Monet used photographs caused something of a scandal when this expedient was revealed in 1905 thanks to the indiscreet and possibly malicious comments of several of Monet&#x2019;s London acquaintances, including Sargent. Monet had risked a similar kind of scandal when he took one of his Rouen Cathedral paintings to Norway.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There was another irony to Monet&#x2019;s paintings. Many of them evoked gorgeous visions of rural tranquility: sun-dappled summer afternoons along a riverbank or fashionable women promenading in flowery meadows. As Mirbeau wrote, nature appeared in Monet&#x2019;s paintings in &#x201c;warm breaths of love&#x201d; and &#x201c;spasms of joy.&#x201d; His pleasingly bucolic scenes were combined with a flickering brushwork that produced delicious vibrations of color. The overall result was that many observers regarded his paintings as possessing a soothing effect on both the eye and the brain&#x2014;and Monet himself as&nbsp;<i>le peintre du bonheur&nbsp;</i>(the painter of happiness). Geffroy believed Monet&#x2019;s works could offer comforting distraction and alleviate fatigue, while Monet himself speculated that they might calm &#x201c;nerves strained through overwork&#x201d; and offer the stressed out viewer &#x201c;an asylum of peaceful meditation.&#x201d; The writer Marcel Proust, an ardent admirer, even believed Monet&#x2019;s paintings could play a spiritually curative role &#x201c;analogous to that of psychotherapists with certain neurasthenics&#x201d;&#x2014;by which he meant those whose weakened nerves&nbsp;had left them at the mercy of fast-paced modern life. Proust was not alone. More than a century later, an Impressionist expert at Sotheby&#x2019;s in London called Monet &#x201c;the great anti-depressant.&#x201d;&nbsp;This &#x201c;great anti-depressant&#x201d; was, however, a neurasthenic who enjoyed anything but peaceful meditation as he worked on his paintings. Geffroy described Monet as &#x201c;a perpetual worrier, forever anguished,&#x201d; while to Clemenceau he was&nbsp;<i>le monstre&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>le roi des grincheux</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;king of the grumps.&#x201d; Monet could be volatile and bad-tempered at the best of times, but when work at his easel did not proceed to his satisfaction&#x2014;lamentably often&#x2014;he flew into long and terrible rages. Clemenceau neatly summed up the quintessential Monet scenario of the artist throwing a tantrum in the midst of blissful scenery: &#x201c;I imagine you in a Niagara of rainbows,&#x201d; he wrote to Monet, &#x201c;picking a fight with the sun.&#x201d; Monet&#x2019;s letters are filled with references to his gloom and anger. Part of his problem was the weather. Monet could pick a fight with the sun, the wind, or the rain. Painting in the open air left him at the mercy of the elements, at which he raged like King Lear. His constant gripes about the wind and rain had once earned him a scolding from Mirbeau: &#x201c;As for the nauseatingly horrible weather we have and that we will have until the end of August, you have the right to curse. But to believe that you&#x2019;re finished as a painter because it&#x2019;s raining and windy&#x2014;this is pure madness.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a strange contradiction of Monet&#x2019;s practice that he wished to work in warm, calm, sunny conditions, and yet for much of his career he chose to paint in Normandy: a part of France that was, as a nineteenth-century guidebook glumly affirmed, &#x201c;generally cold and wet...subject to rapid and frequent changes, and fairly long spells of bad weather that result in unseasonable temperatures.&#x201d; Working on the windswept coast of Normandy in the spring of 1896, he found conditions exasperating. &#x201c;Yesterday I thought I would go mad,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;The wind blew away my canvases and, when I set down my palette to recover them, the wind blew it away too. I was so furious I almost threw everything away.&#x201d; Sometimes Monet did in fact throw everything away. On one occasion he hurled his color box into the river Epte in a blind rage, then was obliged to telegraph Paris, once he calmed down, to have a new one delivered. On another occasion, he flung himself into the Seine. &#x201c;Luckily no harm was done,&#x201d; he reassured a friend.&nbsp;Monet&#x2019;s canvases likewise felt his wrath. Jean-Pierre Hosched� witnessed him committing &#x201c;acts of violence&#x201d; against them, slashing them with a penknife, stamping them into the ground or thrusting his foot through them. An American visitor saw a painting of one of his stepdaughters with &#x201c;a tremendous crisscross rent right through the centre&#x201d;&#x2014;the result of an enraged Monet giving it a vicious kick. Since he had been wearing wooden clogs at the time, the damage was considerable. Sometimes he even set fire to his canvases before he could be stopped. On occasion his rages became so intense that he would roam the fields and then, to spare his family, check into a hotel nearby in Vernon. At other times he retreated to his bedroom for days at a time, refusing both meals and attempts at consolation. Friends tried to coax him from his gloom with diverting trips to Paris. &#x201c;Come to Paris for two days,&#x201d; Mirbeau pleaded with him during one of these spells. &#x201c;We shall walk. We shall go here and there...to the Jardin des Plantes, which is an&nbsp;admirable thing, and to the Th��tre-Fran�ais. We shall eat well, we shall say stupid things, and we shall not see any paintings.&#x201d; There was another contradiction in Monet&#x2019;s practice. He loved to paint and, indeed, he lived to paint&#x2014;and yet he claimed to find painting an unremitting torment. &#x201c;This satanic painting tortures me,&#x201d; he once wrote to a friend, the painter Berthe Morisot. To a journalist he said: &#x201c;Many people think I paint easily, but it is not an easy thing to be an artist. I often suffer tortures when I paint. It is a great joy and a great suffering.&#x201d; Monet&#x2019;s rage and suffering before his easel reveal the disingenuousness of his famous comment about Vincent van Gogh. Mirbeau, who owned Van Gogh&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Irises</i>, once proudly showed the work to Monet. &#x201c;How did a man who loved flowers and light so much,&#x201d; Monet responded, &#x201c;and who painted them so well, make himself so unhappy?&#x201d; Some of Monet&#x2019;s friends regarded his torture and suffering as a necessary condition of his genius&#x2014;as a symptom of his search for perfection, or what Geffroy called the &#x201c;dream of form and color&#x201d; that he pursued &#x201c;almost to the point of self-annihilation.&#x201d; After witnessing yet another fit of dyspepsia, Clemenceau wrote to Monet that &#x201c;if you were not pushed by an eternal search for the unattainable, you would not be the author of so many masterpieces.&#x201d; As Clemenceau once explained to his secretary apropos of Monet&#x2019;s dreadful fits of temper: &#x201c;One must suffer. One must not be satisfied...With a painter who slashes his canvases, who weeps, who explodes with rage in front of his painting, there&nbsp;is hope.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Clemenceau must have realized that in persuading Monet to paint large-scale canvases of his water lily pond he had not only rekindled the painter&#x2019;s hopes but also, as a sore temptation to fate, his exasperation and rage.</p><h2>To Kill the Irishman: The War That Crippled the Mafia</h2><p>Describes Irishman Danny Greene&#39;s battle to break the Italian stranglehold on organized crime in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1970s.</p><p>If you trace the decline of the Italian-American Mafia to one point in time, that point would be the murder of Danny Greene. In the seventies, the fearless Irishman boldly muscled in on the Mafia. <p>Danny was a formidable opponent - intrepid, charismatic, shrewd and cunning. His master plan was to take over the rackets from the Italians under the auspices of the Irish banner. You see, Danny was fiercely proud of his roots. His name was Greene and his signature color was green. His "luck of the Irish" seemed inexhaustible as did the loyalty of his beloved guardian angel. </p><p>With every bungled mob attempt on his life, Danny's reputation for being indestructible grew. He seemed to have the soul of a Celtic warrior, the fighting machine who knew not the meaning of fear - who despised the thought of a life of meaningless old age, but instead preferred to die in battle, and have his legend live on in history. </p><p>In the end, the war with Danny Greene would only begin to haunt La Cosa Nostra. As a result of the numerous investigations, several high-ranking Mafiosi betrayed omerta, the Sicilian code of silence, in effect sentencing themselves to death. Their testimony would help cripple Mafia families in Los Angeles, Kansas City, Milwaukee and Cleveland and aid in the historic 1986 "commission trial" convictions of the bosses of New York's Bonnano, Colombo, Luchesse and Genovese crime families. </p><p>Danny would have been proud. This is his story.</p>Rick Porrello is a veteran Cleveland-area police officer with Mafia roots. He is author of <i>The Rise and Fall of the Cleveland Mafia</i>. Porrello began writing his first book during research into the murders of his grandfather and three uncles, who were mob leaders killed in Prohibition-era violence. The book, published in 1995 by Barricade Books of New York City, quickly became a regional favorite. <p>Porrello is an accomplished jazz musician and soloist, and spent three years traveling worldwide as the drummer for the late Sammy Davis Jr. He continues to perform in the N.E.

Built in the late nineteenth century by a couple of friends from Boston who shared the sentiment that an island without a golf course is an island deficient in the only thing that truly matters, it dominates the western coastline with an uninterrupted view of the ocean. To the right, a candy-cane red-and-white lighthouse stands on a grassy hill, used more for birdwatchers nowadays than sailors lost at sea; and to the left, yellow beaches and grassy sand dunes undulate like waves, carrying on their crests thick clusters of wild rose. A softer variety of climbing rose adorns the walls of the clubhouse, and dusty pink hydrangeas are planted in a border that runs all the way around the periphery, blossoming into a profusion of fat, flowery balls. The effect is so charming that it is impossible not to be touched by it. And rising above it all, on the gray slate roof, the American flag flutters in the salty wind that sweeps in off the sea.<br> <br>Reachable only by small plane or boat, the island of Tekanasset is cut off from the rest of the country, so that while the Industrial Revolution changed the face of America, it missed Tekanasset altogether, leaving the quaint, Quaker-�inspired buildings and cobbled streets as they had always been, and allowing the island to settle into a sleepy, wistful rhythm where old-fashioned values blended harmoniously with the traditional architecture.<br> <br>There are no unsightly road signs or traffic lights on Tekanasset, and the shops that thrive in the town are charming boutiques selling linen, gifts, pretty toiletries, and locally crafted lightship baskets and scrimshaw. It is a nostalgic, romantic place, but not unsophisticated. Famous writers, actors, and musicians from all over America escape the frenetic, polluted cities to breathe the fresh sea air and find inspiration in the beauty of the landscape, while wealthy businessmen leave the financial centers of the world to summer there with their families.<br> <br>Crab Cove Golf Club is still the heart of the island, as it was always intended to be, but now it is no longer the hub of gossip that it was in the sixties and seventies, when society struggled to keep up with the changing times, and the old ways clashed with the new like waves against rock. Nowadays the young people who had fought so hard for change are old and less judgmental than their parents were, and conversation around the tables at teatime is more benign. But on this particular evening in July 1973, an incident which would not even merit comment today had whipped the ladies of Crab Cove Golf Club into a fever of excitement. They had barely glanced at their bridge cards before the subject which had been teetering on the end of their tongues toppled off into an outburst of indignation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, my dear, I think it&#x2019;s immoral and I&#x2019;m ashamed on her behalf,&#x201d; said Evelyn Durlacher in her low Boston drawl, pursing her scarlet lips in disapproval. Evelyn was the weather�vane of polite society. Everything in her environs reflected her conservative values and high moral standards. From her immaculate cashmere twinsets and auburn coiffure to her beautifully decorated home and well-mannered children, nothing escaped her attention. And with the same scrupulous application, and a habitual lack of generosity, she passed judgment on those around her. &#x201c;In our day, if you wanted to be alone with a man, you had to lose your chaperone. Now the young are out of control and no one seems to be keeping an eye.&#x201d; She tapped her red talons on the table and glanced at her cards distractedly. &#x201c;Terrible hand. Sorry, Belle, I fear I&#x2019;m going to let you down.&#x201d;<br> <br>Belle Bartlett studied her cards, which were no better. She took a long drag on her cigarette and shook her blond curls dolefully. &#x201c;The youth of today,&#x201d; she lamented. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be young now. It was better back in the forties and fifties when everyone knew where they stood. Now the lines are all blurred and we have no choice but to adapt. I think they are simply lost and we mustn&#x2019;t judge them too harshly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Belle, you always try to see the good in everybody. Surely even you must concede that Trixie Valentine has let herself down,&#x201d; Evelyn insisted. &#x201c;The fact is, she has not behaved like a lady. Ladies don&#x2019;t go chasing boys around the country. They allow themselves to be chased. Really, it&#x2019;s very distasteful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not only distasteful, Evelyn, it&#x2019;s imprudent,&#x201d; Sally Pearson agreed, giving her lustrous waves of long brown hair a self-conscious toss. &#x201c;By throwing themselves at men they tarnish their reputations, which can never be restored.&#x201d; She waved her cigarette between two manicured fingers and smiled smugly, remembering the exemplary young woman she had been. &#x201c;A man needs the chase and the woman needs to be a prize worth fighting for. Girls are far too easily won these days. In our day we saved ourselves for our wedding night.&#x201d; She giggled and gave a little snort. &#x201c;And if we didn&#x2019;t, we sure as hell didn&#x2019;t let anyone know about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Poor Grace, to have a daughter shame her in this way is very unfortunate,&#x201d; Belle added sympathetically. &#x201c;Horrible to think we&#x2019;re all picking at the pieces like vultures.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, what do you expect, girls?&#x201d; interjected Blythe Westrup, patting her ebony updo. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s British. They won the war but they lost their morals in the process. Goodness, the stories that came out of that time are shocking. Girls lost their heads . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And everything else,&#x201d; Evelyn added dryly, arching an eyebrow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Evelyn!&#x201d; Sally gasped, and placed her cigarette holder between her lips to disguise her smile. She didn&#x2019;t want her friends to see her taking pleasure in the scandal.<br> <br>&#x201c;But do we really know she ran off with him?&#x201d; Belle asked. &#x201c;I mean, it might just be malicious gossip. Trixie&#x2019;s a character but she&#x2019;s not bad. Everyone&#x2019;s much too quick to criticize her. If she wasn&#x2019;t so beautiful, no one would even notice her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Evelyn glared at her fiercely, the rivalry in her eyes suddenly exposed. &#x201c;My dear, I heard it all from Lucy this morning,&#x201d; she said firmly. &#x201c;Believe me, my daughter knows what she&#x2019;s talking about. She saw them all coming off a private boat at dawn, looking the worse for wear and very shifty. The boy is English, too, and he&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; She paused and drew her lips into a line so thin they almost disappeared. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in a rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll band.&#x201d; She articulated the words with disdain as if they gave off a stench.<br> <br>Belle laughed. &#x201c;Evelyn, rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll is over. I believe he&#x2019;s more Bob Dylan than Elvis Presley.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, so you know, do you?&#x201d; Evelyn asked, put out. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The whole town is talking about them, Evelyn. They&#x2019;re handsome young British boys, and polite, too, I believe.&#x201d; She smiled at the sour look on Evelyn&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re spending the summer here at Joe Hornby&#x2019;s place.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Old Joe Hornby? Really, you know how eccentric he is,&#x201d; said Sally. &#x201c;He claims to be a great friend of Mick Jagger&#x2019;s, but have you ever seen him on the island?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or anyone of any importance at all? He claims to know everybody. He&#x2019;s an old boaster, that&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; said Blythe.<br> <br>&#x201c;Those boys are writing an album, apparently, and Joe&#x2019;s helping them,&#x201d; Belle continued. &#x201c;He has a recording studio in his basement.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Joe hasn&#x2019;t produced anything in fifty years!&#x201d; said Sally. &#x201c;He was a very mediocre musician in his day. Now he&#x2019;s simply past it. Anyway, who&#x2019;s bankrolling the project? Joe hasn&#x2019;t got the money, for sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Belle shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. But the word is, he&#x2019;s taking them on tour around the country in the fall.&#x201d; She raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll cost a small fortune, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>Evelyn was determined to bring the subject back to the scandal. She glanced around the room cautiously and lowered her voice. &#x201c;Well, according to Lucy, Trixie Valentine and her friend Suzie Redford disappeared in a boat with the band on Friday evening and didn&#x2019;t come back until early this morning. Suzie told Lucy not to breathe a word to anybody. They clearly went behind their parents&#x2019; backs. I can&#x2019;t say what they all got up to, but I don&#x2019;t think we have to stretch our imaginations too far to get close to the truth. You know how those sort of people live. It&#x2019;s disgusting!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe Grace thought Trixie was at Suzie&#x2019;s!&#x201d; Belle suggested. &#x201c;There must be an explanation.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sally cut in. &#x201c;I daresay, but that Suzie Redford can do whatever she likes. There are no boundaries in that family.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m surprised,&#x201d; said Belle quietly. &#x201c;Though I know Grace has a difficult time with Trixie. But I really don&#x2019;t believe Trixie would have disappeared for three days without telling her mother. Besides, Freddie would never have allowed it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Freddie&#x2019;s been away on business,&#x201d; said Sally gleefully. &#x201c;While the cat&#x2019;s away . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all in the nurturing,&#x201d; said Blythe. &#x201c;Cherchez la m�re,&#x201d; she added darkly.<br> <br>Belle stubbed out her cigarette. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t the saying cherchez la femme?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It amounts to the same thing, Belle,&#x201d; Blythe retorted. &#x201c;You need look no further than the mother. Grace might be a paragon of virtue and I am the first to say she is the sweetest person alive. But she&#x2019;s much too lenient. Trixie needs a firm hand and Grace is weak.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Grace is indulgent because it took her years of heartache and miscarriage to conceive,&#x201d; Belle reminded them. &#x201c;Trixie is the longed-for only child. It&#x2019;s no wonder she&#x2019;s a bit spoiled.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Grace buries her head in her gardens and tries not to think about it, I imagine,&#x201d; said Sally. &#x201c;With a daughter like Trixie, wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, she&#x2019;s a wonderful gardener,&#x201d; Belle added emphatically. &#x201c;The gardens of Tekanasset were all very ordinary before she arrived from England and transformed them with her wonderful taste and expertise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Evelyn scowled irritably. &#x201c;No one is questioning her talent, Belle. It&#x2019;s her mothering which is open to debate. Now, come on, who dealt?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did,&#x201d; said Blythe. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m bidding one no trump.&#x201d;<br> <br>At that moment the four women were struck dumb by the appearance of Grace herself, followed by a large souffl� of a woman known to everyone as Big. Evelyn closed her mouth sharply. Big was the most respected and formidable woman on the island. Not only did she own the largest and oldest home, which had once belonged to the first settler back in 1668, but she was the only daughter of the wealthy oil baron Randall Wilson Jr., who died at the age of ninety-five, leaving his entire fortune to her. It was said that she had never married because she could find no man qualified to match her in either wealth or spirit. Now that she was in her seventies, marriage was never mentioned or alluded to and Big showed no sign of regret. She treated her closest friends like family and took great pleasure, as her father had done before her, in sharing her wealth through the highly esteemed Randall Wilson Charitable Trust, or simply by writing checks when she felt so inclined.<br> <br>Grace Valentine looked as out of place in the clubhouse as a shire horse in a field of thoroughbreds. Her long mouse-brown hair was streaked with gray and pinned roughly onto the back of her head with a pencil, and her taupe cotton trousers and loose-fitting shirt were in sharp contrast to the starched perfection of the four bridge players. The only thing she seemed to have in common with them was the sparkle of diamonds in the form of a surprisingly exquisite bumblebee brooch pinned to her chest. Her nails were bitten down, and the skin on her hands was rough from years of gardening. She wore no makeup, and her fine English skin had suffered in the Tekanasset sun and sea winds. And yet her hazel eyes were full of softness and compassion and her face retained traces of her former beauty. When Grace Valentine smiled, few could resist the sweetness of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Grace,&#x201d; said Belle as the two women passed their table. &#x201c;Hello, Big.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grace smiled. &#x201c;Good game?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not looking good for me,&#x201d; Belle replied. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not very good at bridge.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, really, Belle Bartlett, you&#x2019;re just fine,&#x201d; chided Evelyn, tossing Grace a smile and scrutinizing her for signs of shame. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just being modest.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where would you like to sit, Grace?&#x201d; Big asked, striding past the four women without so much as a nod. They shrank into their chairs guiltily. Big seemed to have an almost psychic sense when it came to unpleasantness, and she narrowed her eyes knowingly and struck the shiny wooden floorboards with her walking stick without any concern for the noise it made.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s sit outside, if it&#x2019;s not too windy for you, Big,&#x201d; Grace replied.<br> <br>Big chuckled. &#x201c;Not at all. If there was a hurricane, I&#x2019;d be the last person standing.&#x201d;<br> <br>They walked through the double doors onto a wide veranda which overlooked the ocean. Small boats cut through the waves like swans and a pair of black dogs frolicked about the dunes while their master strolled slowly up the beach. The evening sun was low in the sky, turning the sand a pinkish hue, and an oystercatcher pecked at the remains of a fish with his bright-orange beak. Grace chose a table nearest the edge of the veranda, against the balustrade, and pulled out a wicker chair for Big. The old woman handed Grace her stick, then fell onto the cushion with a loud whoosh. A few wisps of gray hair fell away from her bun and flapped against the back of her neck like feathers. &#x201c;There, the hen is on her nest,&#x201d; said Big with a satisfied sigh. She clicked her fingers and before Grace had even sat down she had ordered them both a cocktail. &#x201c;You need fortification, Grace,&#x201d; she told her firmly. &#x201c;Never mind those hyenas. They&#x2019;re all so jealous of you, as well they might be: they have not an ounce of talent between them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all right,&#x201d; Grace replied. &#x201c;Believe me, I&#x2019;ve encountered far worse.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you have. British women make those four look positively tame.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grace laughed. &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t care what people say behind my back, as long as they&#x2019;re friendly to my face. The trouble with British women is they&#x2019;re much too outspoken, and I do hate confrontation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I prefer the British way, if that&#x2019;s the case. If people have something to say, they should say it to your face and not behind your back. They should have the courage of their convictions or not speak out at all. Evelyn Durlacher is a terrible old wooden spoon and I&#x2019;m quite prepared to tell her so. She should be ashamed of some of the trouble she&#x2019;s caused on this island with her stirring. It&#x2019;s as if she goes around looking for things to gossip about. The smugness of the woman is intolerable. She has placed herself so high on her pedestal, the fall will be devastating.&#x201d;<br> <br>The waiter placed their cocktails on the table with a china bowl of nuts. Big thrust her fat, bejeweled fingers into the bowl and grabbed a fistful of pistachios. Her face was deceptively gentle, with a wide forehead, full, smiling lips, and spongy chins that gave her the look of a gentle grandmother, but her eyes were the color of steel and could harden in a moment, turning the unlucky recipient of her displeasure into a pillar of salt. When she looked at Grace, however, she did so with surprising tenderness. &#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s Trixie up to, then? I imagine Evelyn has exaggerated the story fo...</p><h2>Pain, Pain, Go Away</h2><p>I have been using reconstructive therapy (prolotherapy, sclerotherapy) for over 25 years.

A serious social problem emerged in this new society: hyperorexia, or severe overeating, a side effect of the Pure Trance life-sustaining pill. This dreamy science fiction fantasy &#x2014; a sexy story of catfights, alien safari adventures, evil experimentation, and a girl who dreams of becoming a pop idol singer&#x2014;is the long-awaited debut graphic novel of famous Japanese manga artist Junko Mizuno.

She recalls her stint as a waitress in the Catskills and a failed friendship with an older woman and mentor; she reconsiders her experiences in the feminist movement, while living alone, and in marriage.<br>Turning her sharp eye on herself, Gornick struggles to see her part in things - how she has both welcomed and avoided contact, and how these attempts at connections have enlivened and, at times, defeated her.

Everyone else is feasting, you alone cannot gain a seat at the table.&#34; In the essay, &#34;On Living Alone,&#34; she writes, &#34;This is a population in a permanent state of intermittent attachment.

Straining to see in the moonlight, striving to fathom mustang ways, I knew instinctively I had chanced upon something important but could not know that it would shape my life. In 1948 I was a boy of thirteen learning the language of horses. . . .&#34;</p><p>Monty Roberts is, as they say, the <i>real</i> horse whisperer--even if he does revile the last third of Nicholas Evans's romance. Yet Roberts also makes clear from the start that listening and close attention have more to do with gentling an animal than soi-disant whispering. As far as he's concerned, silent communication can "effectively cross over the boundary between human (the ultimate fight animal) and horse (the flight animal). Using their language, their system of communication, I could create a strong bond of trust. I would achieve cross-species communication." And achieve it he does. After one short session, he has even the wildest stallion nickering with ungulate abandon. <p> Roberts's descriptions of "joining up," as he calls it with horses--as well as with the deer who cavort on his California farm like so many hyperintelligent Bambis--are inspirational in the best sense of the word. Surprisingly, though, it took him long years to persuade most of the humans in his life that pain and punishment are not the way to go. Indeed, the author expends many a page on past mistakes and disasters, familial and professional. Yet <i>The Man Who Listens to Horses</i> remains a powerfully positive document--and not just for Mr. Ed. Best of all, when it comes to his life's work, Roberts is far more practical than mystical. Instead of portraying himself as Equus's messiah, he'd rather share his hard-won knowledge. Having overcome years of rejection and ridicule, the author is certainly not short in the self-esteem department, as some passages in this book demonstrate. No matter. He always checks his ego before entering the corral. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"His portrait of the business of breeding and training horses is frank and fascinating, but the book's most memorable passages cover rodeos and horse business in the west as it was in the author's youth, and include a haunting portrait of his violent, racist father and some of the other remarkable figures Roberts knew (including a young James Dean). Over and above everything, though, is Roberts' surpassing love for horses, captured here in his evocations of the horses he has trained over a career spanning four decades."<br>--<b>Kirkus Reviews</b><p>"This book is important reading for those interested in communication, particularly interspecies communication and linguistics."<br>--<b>Publisher's Weekly</b></p><p>"Monty Roberts' book <b>The Man Who Listens to Horses</b> has inspired me to the depths of my soul. Observing Monty's philosophy and method of working with horses and people is one of the most profoundly deep, awe-inspiring, and heart-opening experiences I've ever witnessed. I highly recommend this book to everyone."<br>--Jack Canfield, co-author of the <b>Chicken Soup for the Soul</b> series</p></p><h2>The Man on Mao&#39;s Right: From Harvard Yard to Tiananmen Square, My Life Inside China&#39;s Foreign Ministry</h2><p>No other narrative from within the corridors of power has offered as frank and intimate an account of the making of the modern Chinese nation as Ji Chaozhu&#x2019;s <i>The Man on Mao&#x2019;s Right</i>. Having served Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist leadership for two decades, and having become a key figure in China&#x2019;s foreign policy, Ji now provides an honest, detailed account of the personalities and events that shaped today&#x2019;s People&#x2019;s Republic.<br><br>The youngest son of a prosperous government official, nine-year-old Ji and his family fled Japanese invaders in the late 1930s, escaping to America. Warmly received by his new country, Ji returned its embrace as he came of age in New York&#x2019;s East Village and then attended Harvard University. But in 1950, after years of enjoying a life of relative ease while his countrymen suffered through war and civil strife, Ji felt driven by patriotism to volunteer to serve China in its conflict with his adoptive country in the Korean War.<br><br>Ji&#x2019;s mastery of the English language and American culture launched his improbable career, eventually winning him the role of English interpreter for China&#x2019;s two top leaders: Premier Zhou Enlai and Party Chairman Mao Zedong. With a unique blend of Chinese insight and American candor, Ji paints insightful portraits of the architects of modern China: the urbane, practical, and avuncular Zhou, the conscience of the People&#x2019;s Republic; and the messianic, charismatic Mao, student of China&#x2019;s ancient past&#x2013;his country&#x2019;s stern father figure.<br><br>In Ji&#x2019;s memoir, he is an eyewitness to modern Chinese history, including the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, the Nixon summit, and numerous momentous events in Tiananmen Square. As he becomes caught up in political squabbles among radical factions, Ji&#x2019;s past and charges against him of &#x201c;incorrect&#x201d; thinking subject him to scrutiny and suspicion. He is repeatedly sent to a collective farm to be &#x201c;reeducated&#x201d; by the peasants.<br><br>After the Mao years, Ji moves on to hold top diplomatic posts in the United States and the United Kingdom and then serves as under secretary-general of the United Nations. Today, he says, &#x201c;The Chinese know America better than the Americans know China. The risk is that we misperceive each other.&#x201d; This highly accessible insider&#x2019;s chronicle of a struggling people within a developing powerhouse nation is also Ji Chaozhu&#x2019;s dramatic personal story, certain to fascinate and enlighten Western readers.<br><br>A riveting biography and unique historical record, <i>The Man on Mao&#x2019;s Right </i>recounts the heartfelt struggle of a man who loved two powerful nations that were at odds with each other. Ji Chaozhu played an important role in paving the way for what is destined to be known as the Chinese Century.<br><br>Praise for <i>The Man on Mao&#x2019;s Right </i><br><br>"Brave, beautifully written testimony .

Throughout his decorated career, he has held posts in China&#x2019;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (where he was deputy director of the Department of Translation and Interpretation and deputy director of American and Oceanic Affairs). In 1982, he was appointed minister counselor of the Embassy of the People&#x2019;s Republic of China in the United States of America, and has served as China&#x2019;s ambassador to Fiji, Kiribati, Vanuatu, and the Court of St. James&#x2019;s. From 1991 to 1996, he served as the under secretary-general of the United Nations. He currently resides in China with his wife.The very American Norman Dietz would not have been my first choice to read a book about someone who lived through the birth and rise of modern communist China. The book is clearly a personal reminiscence and not a straight history. But soon listeners are accustomed to the Chinese names, and Dietz&#39;s lack of an accent no longer matters--the content of the book does. That&#39;s one of the beauties of audio literature. The fact that the writer spent his youth in America and writes in American English also helps. The book offers an interesting and personal view of the Communist Revolution, the Cultural Revolution, the Nixon summit, and Tiananmen Square.

In recent years, interest in mindfulness has exploded and it is now a part of popular culture. Increasingly, creative pursuits such as coloring are being used as a way for people to focus and enter a mindful state. Each project starts with a brief description and background to the model. Subsequent pages give instructions for folding the particular model. For difficult exercises, the book details ways of staying focused and calm and using mindfulness to deal with frustration or distraction. This is an important part of mindfulness and leads to a range of benefits for wellbeing and performance. Once each model is folded, the book then outlines various related exercises that can help to further develop mindfulness. For example, after folding the paper boat, readers are encouraged to lie down and place the boat on their belly and watch it rock up and down on the "waves" as they breathe. This helps them develop mindful breathing, which is a powerful tool for relaxation and focus. High-quality patterned origami paper and coloring sheets, which can easily be torn from the book, are included to make this the ultimate gift for anyone wanting a calmer, more stress-free life.</p></p><p><p><b> Dr. Richard Chambers</b> is a clinical psychologist in private practice, specializing in mindfulness-based therapies.

It&#x2019;s been just the three of them ever since McDuff moved in! Is there really room for one more in their family?</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1. In another winning story about the perky West Highland white terrier, McDuff, and his owners, Lucy and Fred, a new baby joins the family. Since the infant interferes with the dog's favorite activities of listening to the comics read aloud, taking woodsy walks, and enjoying a nightly musical program on the radio (not to mention no longer being the center of attention), he rebels by glowering at the plump child and then by refusing his food. His understanding owners immediately resume McDuff's beloved routine, and he begins tentative communication with the little girl.

He worked as an aeronautical engineer and published his first novel, Marazan, in 1926. In 1931 he married Frances Mary Heaton and they went on to have two daughters. During the Second World War he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve where he worked on developing secret weapons. After the war he continued to write and settled in Australia where he lived until his death on 12 January 1960. His most celebrated novels include Pied Piper (1942), No Highway (1948), A Town Like Alice (1950) and On the Beach (1957).I<br><br>James Macfadden died in March 1905 when he was forty-seven years old; he was riding in the Driffield Point-to-Point. He left the bulk of his money to his son Douglas. The Macfaddens and the Dalhousies at that time lived in Perth, and Douglas was a school friend of Jock Dalhousie, who was a young man then, and had gone to London to become junior partner in a firm of solicitors in Chancery Lane, Owen, Dalhousie, and Peters. I am now the senior partner, and Owen and Dalhousie and Peters have been dead for many years, but I never changed the name of the firm.<br><br>It was natural that Douglas Macfadden should put his affairs into the hands of Jock Dalhousie, and Mr Dalhousie handled them personally till he died in 1928. In splitting up the work I took Mr Macfadden on to my list of clients, and forgot about him in the pressure of other matters.<br><br>It was not until 1935 that any business for him came up. I had a letter from him then, from an address in Ayr. He said that his brother-in-law, Arthur Paget, had been killed in a motor car accident in Malaya and so he wanted to redraft his will to make a trust in favour of his sister Jean and her two children. I am sorry to say that I was so ignorant of this client that I did not even know he was unmarried and had no issue of his own. He finished up by saying that he was too unwell to travel down to London, and he suggested that perhaps a junior member of the firm might be sent up to see him and arrange the matter.<br><br>This fitted in with my arrangements fairly well, because when I got this letter I was just leaving for a fortnight's fishing holiday on Loch Shiel. I wrote and told him that I would visit him on my way south, and I put the file concerning his affairs in the bottom of my suitcase to study one evening during my vacation.<br><br>When I got to Ayr I took a room at the Station Hotel, because in our correspondence there had been no suggestion that he could put me up. I changed out of my plus-fours into -a dark business suit, and went to call upon my client.<br><br>He did not live at all in the manner I had expected. I did not know much about his estate except that it was probably well over twenty thousand pounds, and I had expected to find my client living in a house with a servant or two. Instead, I discovered that he had a bedroom and a sitting-room on the same floor of a small private hotel just off the sea front. He was evidently leading the life of an invalid though he was hardly more than fifty years old at that time, ten years younger than I was myself. He was as frail as an old lady of eighty, and he had a peculiar grey look about him which didn't look at all good to me. All the windows of his sitting-room were shut and after the clean air of the lochs and moors I found his room stuffy and close; he had a number of budgerigars in cages in the window, and the smell of these birds made the room very unpleasant. It was clear from the furnishings that he had lived in that hotel and in that room for a good many years.<br><br>He told me something about his life as we discussed the will; he was quite affable, and pleased that I had been able to come to visit him myself. He seemed to be an educated man, though he spoke with a marked Scots accent. 'I live very quietly, Mr Strachan,' he said. 'My health will not permit me to go far abroad. Whiles I get out upon the front on a fine day and sit for a time, and then again Maggie - that's the daughter of Mrs Doyle who keeps the house - Maggie wheels me out in the chair. They are very good to me here.'<br><br>Turning to the matter of the will, he told me that he had no close relatives at all except his sister, Jean Paget. 'Forbye my father might have left what you might call an indiscretion or two in Australia,' he said. 'I would not say that there might not be some of those about, though I have never met one, or corresponded. Jean told me once that my mother had been sore distressed. Women talk about these things, of course, and my father was a lusty type of man.'<br><br>His sister Jean had been an officer in the WAACs in the 1914-1918 War, and she had married a Captain Paget in the spring of 1917. 'It was not a very usual sort of marriage,' he said thoughtfully. 'You must remember that my sister Jean had never been out of Scotland till she joined the army, and the greater part of her life had been spent in Perth. Arthur Paget was an Englishman from Southampton, in Hampshire. I have nothing against Arthur, but we had all naturally thought that Jean would have married a Scot. Still, I would not say but it has been a happy marriage, or as happy as most.'<br><br>After the war was over Arthur Paget had got a job upon a rubber estate in Malaya somewhere near Taiping, and Jean, of course, went out there with him. From that time Douglas Macfadden had seen little of his sister; she had been home on leave in 1926 and again in 1932. She had two children, Donald born in 1918 and Jean born in 1921; these children had been left in England in 1932 to live with the Paget parents and to go to school in Southampton, while their mother returned to Malaya. My client had seen them only once, in 1932 when their mother brought them up to Scotland.<br><br>The present position was that Arthur Paget had been killed in a motor accident somewhere near Ipoh; he had been driving home at night from Kuala Lumpur and had driven off the road at a high speed and hit a tree. Probably he fell asleep. His widow, Jean Paget, was in England; she had come home a year or so before his death and she had taken a small house in Bassett just outside Southampton to make a home for the children and to be near their schools. It was a sensible arrangement, of course, but it seemed to me to be a pity that the brother and the sister could not have arranged to live nearer to each other. -I fancy that my client regretted the distance that separated them, because he referred to it more than once.<br><br>He wanted to revise his will. His existing will was a very simple one, in which he left his entire estate to his sister Jean. 'I would not alter that,' he said. 'But you must understand that Arthur Paget was alive when 1 made that will, and that in the nature of things 1expected him to be alive when Jean inherited from me, and 1 expected that he would be there to guide her in matters of business. 1 shall not make old bones.'<br><br>He seemed to have a fixed idea that all women were unworldly creatures and incapable of looking after money; they were irresponsible, and at the mercy of any adventurer. Accordingly, although he wanted his sister to have the full use of his money after his death, he wanted to create a trust to ensure that her son Donald, at that time a schoolboy, should inherit the whole estate intact after his mother's death. There was, of course, no special difficulty in that. I presented to him the various pros and cons of a trust such as he envisaged, and 1 reminded him that a small legacy to Mrs Doyle, in whose house he had lived for so many years, might not be out of place provided that he was still living with them at the time of his death. He agreed to that. He told me then that he had no close relations living, and he asked me if I would undertake to be the sole trustee of his estate and the executor of his will. That is the sort of business a family solicitor frequently takes on his shoulders, of course. I told him that in view of my age he should appoint a co-trustee, and he agreed to the insertion of our junior partner, Mr Lester Robinson, to be co-trustee with me. He also agreed to a charging clause for our professional services in connection with the trust.<br><br>There only remained to tidy up the loose ends of what was, after all, a fairly simple will. I asked him what should happen if both he and his sister were to die before the boy Donald was twenty-one, and I suggested that the trust should terminate and the boy should inherit the estate absolutely when he reached his majority. He agreed to this, and I made another note upon my pad.<br><br>'Supposing then,' I said, 'that Donald should die before his mother, or if Donald and his mother should die in some way before you. The estate would then pass to the girl, Jean. Again, I take it that the trust would terminate when she reached her majority?'<br><br>'Ye mean,' he asked, 'when she became twenty-one?'<br><br>I nodded. 'Yes. That is what we decided in the case of her brother.'<br><br>He shook his head. 'I think that would be most imprudent, Mr Strachan, if I may say so. No lassie would be fit to administer her own estate when she was twenty-one. A lassie of that age is at the mercy of her sex, Mr Strachan, at the mercy of her sex. I would want the trust to continue for much longer than that. Till she was forty, at the very least.'<br><br>From various past experiences I could not help agreeing with him that twenty-one was a bit young for a girl to have absolute control over a large sum of money, but forty seemed to me to be excessively old. I stated my own view that twenty-five would be a reasonable age, and very reluctantly he receded to thirty-five. I could not move him from that position, and as he was obviously tiring and growing irritable I accepted that as the maximum duration of our trust. It meant that in those very unlikely circumstances the trust would continue for twenty-one years from that date, since the girl Jean had been born in 1921 and it was then 1935- That finished our business and I left him and went back to London to draft out the will, which I sent to him for signature. I never saw my client again. It was my fault that I lost touch with him. It had been my habit for a great many years to take my holiday in the spring, when I would go with my wife to Scotland for a fortnight's fishing, usually to Loch Shiel. I thought that this was going on for ever, as one does, and that next year I would call again upon this client on my way down from the north to see if there was any other business I could do for him. But things turn out differently, sometimes. In the winter of 1935 Lucy died. I don't want to dwell on that, but we had been married for twenty-seven years and - well, it was very painful. Both our sons were abroad, Harry in his submarine on the China station and Martin in his oil company at Basra. I hadn't the heart to go back to Loch Shiel, and I have never been to Scotland since. I had a sale and got rid of most of our furniture, and I sold our house on Wimbledon Common; one has to make an effort at a time like that, and a clean break. It's no good going on living in the ashes of a dead happiness.<br><br>I took a flat in Buckingham Gate opposite the Palace stables and just across the park from my club in Pall Mall. I furnished it with a few things out of the Wimbledon house and got a woman to come in and cook my breakfast and clean for me in the mornings, and here I set out to re-create my life. I knew the pattern well enough from the experience of others in the club. Breakfast in my flat. Walk through the Park and up the Strand to my office in Chancery Lane. Work all day, with a light lunch at my desk. To the club at six o'clock to read the periodicals, and gossip, and dine, and after dinner a rubber of bridge. That is the routine that I fell into in the spring of 1936, and I am in it still.<br><br>All this, as I say, took my mind from Douglas Macfadden; with more than half my mind upon my own affairs I could only manage to attend to those clients who had urgent business with my office. And presently another interest grew upon me. It was quite obvious that war was coming, and some of us in the club who were too old for active military service began to get very interested in Air Raid Precautions. Cutting the long story short, Civil Defence as it came to be called absorbed the whole of my leisure for the next eight years. I became a Warden, and I was on duty in my district of Westminster all through the London blitz and the long, slow years of war that followed it. Practically all my staff went on service, and I had to run the office almost single-handed. In those years I never took a holiday, and I doubt if I slept more than five hours in any night. When finally peace came in 1945 my hair was white and my head shaky, and though I improved a little in the years that followed I had definitely joined the ranks of the old men.<br><br>One afternoon in January 1948 I got a telegram from Ayr. It read,<br><br>Regret Mr Douglas Macfadden passed away last night please instruct re funeral. Doyle, Balmoral Hotel, Ayr.<br><br>I had to search my memory, I am afraid, to recollect through the war years who Mr Douglas Macfadden was, and then I had to turn to the file and the will to refresh my memory with the details of what had happened thirteen years before. It seemed rather odd to me that there was nobody at Ayr who could manage the funeral business. I put in a trunk call to Ayr right away and very soon I was speaking to Mrs Doyle. It was a bad line, but I understood that she knew of no relations; apparently Mr Macfadden had had no visitors for a very long time. Clearly, I should have to go to Ayr myself, or else send somebody. I had no urgent engagements for the next two days and the matter seemed to be a little difficult. I had a talk with Lester Robinson, my partner, who had come back from the war as a brigadier, and cleared my desk, and took the sleeper up to Glasgow after dinner that night. In the morning I went down in a slow train to Ayr.</p><h2>Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness</h2><p><p>Khalidi critically assesses the narratives that make up Palestinian history and identity and examines the ways in which the Palestinian national consciousness has come full circle.</p></p><p><p>Rashid Khalidi is professor of history and director of the Center for International Studies at the University of Chicago, and past president of the Middle East Studies Association.</p>An impressively thoughtful, layered, and well documented study of key aspects of the evolution of modern Palestinian nationalism. Those expecting either a comprehensive history of the modern Palestinian movement or a polemic against Zionism and Israel should look elsewhere. Khalidi, who teaches history and directs the Center for International Studies at the University of Chicago, and who was a member of the Palestinian delegation to the Mideast peace negotiations, focuses almost entirely on the late Ottoman and early Mandate period (1880s through 1920s). He sees Palestinian nationalism emerging far earlier than is generally thought--in the preWW I period, when absentee landlords in Beirut and elsewhere sold large tracts of Palestinian land to the Jewish Colonization Association. Yet while modern Palestinian history is inextricably intertwined with that of Zionism, Khalidi focuses as much on other constituents of modern Palestinian identity, which include ``patriotic feelings, local loyalties, Arabism, religious sentiments, [and] higher levels of education and literacy.'' He demonstrates how the long-term influence of modernization, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and concomitant European incursion in the preWW I era, followed by the betrayal of promises made by both the British and French, contributed as much to Palestinian nationalism as the 1917 Balfour Declaration and Zionist immigration. The only flaw here is that Khalidi races through the last 70 years of the development of Palestinian identity. Even here, however, he offers a fascinating analysis of why Palestinian nationalism seemingly became ``submerged'' after the first Arab- Israeli War (194749) and until the PLO's founding in 1964. At a time when the end of the hundred years' war between Zionism/Israel and the Palestinians appears on the horizon, this illuminating study will help readers gain a sophisticated understanding of how the Palestinians came to be who they are. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Only recently has science sought in earnest to understand and explain this impact. One remarkable recent study, analyzing the cries of newborns, shows that infants' cries contain common musical intervals. Physics experiments show that sound waves can physically change the structure of a material; musician and world-famous conductor Daniel Barenboim believes musical sound vibrations physically penetrate our bodies, shifting molecules as they do. </p><p><i>The </i><i>Power of Music</i> follows visionary researchers and accomplished musicians to the crossroads of science and culture, to discover: how much of our musicality is learned and how much is innate? Can examining the biological foundations of music help scientists unravel the intricate web of human cognition and brain function? Why is music virtually universal across cultures and time--does it provide some evolutionary advantage? Can music make people healthier? Might music contain organizing principles of harmonic vibration that underlie the cosmos itself?</p></p><p><p><b></b><br><b>Elena Mannes </b>has won six Emmys and many other national awards for her documentaries.
